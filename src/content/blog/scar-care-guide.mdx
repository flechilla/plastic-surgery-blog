## What to Expect Immediately After
Undergoing surgery is a big step, and while the results can be life-changing, the path to recovery is equally important. One of the primary concerns many patients have is how to minimize surgical scars. Right after your procedure, your body begins its natural healing process. This is the ideal time to implement effective scar care techniques to enhance recovery and minimize visible scarring.

## Week-by-Week Timeline
Monitoring your recovery and scar progression can help you adjust your care routine effectively. Below is a general timeline to guide you through the healing process:

| Week | What to Expect |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | Initial swelling and redness are common. Keep the area clean and follow your surgeon’s specific instructions. |
| 2    | Bruising may start to fade. You might notice the formation of a scab. Continue with prescribed topical treatments. |
| 3-4  | Scars may appear darker; this is a normal part of healing. Begin gentle massage if recommended by your surgeon. |
| 5-6  | Scars start to lighten. Regular moisturizing and sun protection are crucial. |
