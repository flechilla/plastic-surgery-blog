## What to Expect Immediately After
Embarking on a journey towards aesthetic enhancement is exciting, yet understanding the path ahead is crucial, especially right after your procedure. Following your plastic surgery consultation, you'll likely feel a mix of anticipation and curiosity about the immediate recovery phase.

The first few hours post-surgery are often spent in a recovery room under close observation. Here, your body begins the initial stages of healing, and you'll gradually awaken from anesthesia. It's normal to feel drowsy and experience mild discomfort, which can be managed with prescribed pain relief. Your surgeon will provide detailed post-operative instructions and ensure you're stable before heading home.

## Week-by-Week Timeline
A clear recovery timeline can help set realistic expectations and alleviate uncertainties. Here's a general overview:

| Week | What to Expect |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | Swelling and bruising peak, rest is crucial, follow up with your surgeon. |
| 2    | Begin gentle movements, some sutures may be removed, reduced discomfort. |
| 3-4  | Noticeable reduction in swelling, return to light activities, follow care tips. |
| 5-6  | Majority of swelling subsides, resume most daily activities, continue follow-ups. |
