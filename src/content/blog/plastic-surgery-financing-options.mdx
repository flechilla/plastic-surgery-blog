## What to Expect Immediately After
Undergoing plastic surgery is a significant decision, and understanding the financial aspects can be just as crucial as the procedure itself. Many patients explore plastic surgery financing to ease the upfront costs associated with their transformation. With options like cosmetic surgery payment plans, patients can focus on recovery without the stress of immediate financial burden.

In the immediate aftermath of surgery, it is common to experience some discomfort, swelling, and bruising. While your surgeon will provide specific post-operative instructions, having a financial plan in place can alleviate additional stress, allowing you to prioritize healing.

## Week-by-Week Timeline
Recovery varies by individual and procedure, but here’s a general guide to what you might expect week-by-week:

| Week | Expectations |
|------|--------------|
| 1    | Initial swelling and bruising; focus on rest and follow-up appointments. |
| 2    | Gradual reduction in swelling; light activities may be resumed. |
| 3-4  | Continued healing; most patients return to work, with approval. |
| 5-6  | Swelling significantly reduced; resume most activities. |
| 7+   | Full recovery; enjoy results with minimal discomfort. |
