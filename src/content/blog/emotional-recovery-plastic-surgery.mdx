| Week | Emotional State |
|------|-----------------|
| 1    | Adjusting to the new reality; common to feel vulnerable or anxious. |
| 2    | Gradual acceptance; mood swings may occur as physical healing begins. |
| 3    | Increasing confidence; starting to appreciate the results. |
| 4    | Emotional stabilization; more positive outlook as healing continues. |
