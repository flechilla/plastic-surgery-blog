## What to Expect Immediately After
After a surgical procedure, wearing compression garments is a crucial step in ensuring optimal recovery. These specially designed garments provide support to the treated area, reduce swelling, and help shape your new contours. It's essential to wear them as recommended by your surgeon to achieve the best results.

## Week-by-Week Timeline
| Week | Activity | Recovery Milestone |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| 1-2  | Minimal Activity | Reduced swelling; initial contour shaping |
| 3-4  | Light Exercise | Increased comfort; continued healing |
| 5-6  | Moderate Exercise | Near-normal mobility; significant reduction in swelling |
| 7-8  | Resume Normal Activities | Final results becoming apparent |

## Do's and Don'ts
### Do's
- Follow your surgeon's instructions meticulously regarding the duration and fit of your compression garments.
- Keep the garments clean and dry to prevent infections.
- Pair garment use with gentle massages as advised by your surgeon.

### Don'ts

- Do not alter the garments without consulting your surgeon.
- Avoid strenuous activities during the initial recovery phase.

## Managing Common Side Effects
It's normal to experience some discomfort and swelling post-surgery. Compression garments help manage these effects by providing consistent pressure, which aids in fluid drainage and minimizes bruising. If you experience severe pain or unusual symptoms, contact your surgeon immediately.

## When to Call Your Surgeon
While minor discomfort is expected, there are signs that warrant a call to your surgeon:
- Persistent or increasing pain
- Unusual swelling or bruising
- Signs of infection, such as fever or redness around the surgical site

## Long-term Care Tips
To maintain your results long-term, continue wearing your compression garments as advised. Regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon will ensure you're progressing well. Adapt healthy lifestyle habits to enhance your results.
