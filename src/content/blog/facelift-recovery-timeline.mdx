## What to Expect Immediately After

Undergoing a facelift is an exciting step towards rejuvenating your appearance. Immediately following the procedure, it's normal to experience some swelling and bruising. Your surgeon will apply bandages to minimize swelling and protect the delicate incision areas. During the first 24-48 hours, you may also experience a tight sensation in your face and neck, which is a typical part of the initial healing process.

## Week-by-Week Timeline

Understanding the week-by-week facelift recovery timeline can greatly assist in managing expectations and planning your schedule. Here's a detailed overview:

| Week | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | Swelling and bruising are most pronounced. Rest is crucial. |
| 2    | Bruising begins to fade, and stitches may be removed. Light activities can resume. |
| 3-4  | Swelling continues to decrease. More social activities can be considered. |
| 5-6  | Most of the swelling is gone. You may return to regular exercise. |
| 6+   | Final results begin to settle. Continual improvement in appearance. |

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do's
- **Follow Post-Operative Instructions:** Your surgeon's guidelines are tailored for your specific needs.
- **Keep Your Head Elevated:** This helps reduce swelling.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Proper hydration aids in healing.

### Don'ts
- **Avoid Strenuous Activities:** This can increase blood pressure and swelling.
- **Don't Smoke:** Smoking can impede healing and affect results.

## Managing Common Side Effects

During recovery after facelift, some common side effects include numbness, tingling, and itchiness. These sensations are typically temporary and improve as the nerves heal. To manage these effectively:

- **Cold Compresses:** Can help with swelling.
- **Over-the-Counter Pain Relief:** Consult your surgeon for recommendations.

## When to Call Your Surgeon

While most recovery experiences are smooth, it's important to know when to reach out to your surgeon. Contact your doctor if you experience:

- **Excessive Bleeding or Swelling:** Beyond what was discussed.
- **Fever or Chills:** Could indicate an infection.
- **Severe Pain:** Not alleviated by prescribed medication.

## Long-term Care Tips
