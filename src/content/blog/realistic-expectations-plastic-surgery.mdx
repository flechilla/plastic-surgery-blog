## What to Expect Immediately After

Undergoing plastic surgery is a transformative journey, and understanding the recovery process is essential for setting realistic expectations. Immediately after your surgery, you may experience a mix of excitement and apprehension as you begin your healing journey. It's crucial to remember that swelling, bruising, and discomfort are common parts of the initial recovery stage.

As your body starts to heal, you may notice some immediate changes, but it's important to be patient as the final results will gradually unfold over the coming weeks and months.

## Week-by-Week Timeline

Here's a general timeline to help you understand what to expect during your recovery:

| Week | Expectations |
|------|--------------|
| 1    | Swelling and bruising are at their peak. Rest and follow your surgeon's post-operative instructions.|
| 2    | Swelling begins to subside. Light activities may resume, but avoid strenuous exercise. |
| 3-4  | Bruising fades. You may start to see early results, but patience is key. |
| 5-6  | Most of the swelling has diminished. Resume normal activities with caution. |
| 6+   | Final results become more apparent. Continue following your surgeon's advice for optimal healing.|

## Do's and Don'ts

To ensure a smooth recovery, consider the following tips:

**Do's:**
- Follow your surgeon's post-operative care instructions meticulously.
- Keep incisions clean and dry to prevent infection.

**Don'ts:**
