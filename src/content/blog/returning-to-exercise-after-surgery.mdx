## What to Expect Immediately After Surgery

After undergoing plastic surgery, it’s natural to feel eager to return to your routine, including exercise. However, patience is crucial to ensure a healthy recovery. Your body needs time to heal, and understanding the recovery process can help you plan a safe return to physical activities. Depending on the type of surgery, immediate post-operative instructions may vary, but generally involve rest, hydration, and gentle movement to promote circulation.

## Week-by-Week Timeline

| Week | Activity Level | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| 1-2  | Rest and Recovery | Focus on light walking to encourage blood flow and prevent blood clots. Avoid strenuous activities. |
| 3-4  | Light Activity | Gradually introduce light stretching and range-of-motion exercises. Listen to your body and avoid overexertion. |
| 5-6  | Moderate Exercise | Begin low-impact activities such as cycling or swimming. Continue to avoid heavy lifting and high-impact workouts. |
| 7+   | Gradual Return to Routine | Slowly increase intensity, paying attention to your body's response. Consult your surgeon before resuming full workout routines. |

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do's
- Follow your surgeon's specific post-operative instructions.
- Start with gentle movements and gradually increase intensity.
- Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet to support healing.
