## What to Expect Immediately After

Undergoing surgery is a significant step towards achieving your aesthetic goals. However, it's also essential to understand what comes next, particularly regarding swelling after surgery. Swelling is a natural response by your body as it heals, and knowing how to manage it can profoundly affect your recovery journey.

Immediately after surgery, you may notice significant swelling in the area operated on. This is most pronounced in the first 48 to 72 hours and can vary depending on the type of procedure and individual factors such as your body’s natural healing process. While it can be concerning, rest assured that this is a normal part of healing.

## Week-by-Week Timeline

Understanding the typical progression of swelling can help set your expectations and guide your recovery process.

| Week | Expectations |
|------|--------------|
| 1    | Swelling peaks, often paired with some bruising. Follow your surgeon's post-op care instructions closely. |
| 2    | Swelling begins to decrease, though it may still be noticeable. Continue using prescribed medications and ice packs. |
| 3-4  | Gradual reduction in swelling. You may start to see more refined results. Continue to avoid strenuous activities. |
| 5-6  | Most swelling should significantly subside. You can usually begin gentle exercises, but confirm with your surgeon. |
| 7+   | Residual swelling may persist, but it's typically minimal. Monitor for any unusual changes and maintain regular follow-ups. |
