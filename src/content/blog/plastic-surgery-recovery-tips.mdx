## What to Expect Immediately After
Embarking on the journey of plastic surgery is a significant decision, and understanding the recovery process is crucial. Immediately after surgery, you may experience some discomfort, swelling, and bruising, which are all normal parts of the healing process. Dr. David Kim emphasizes the importance of following your surgeon's specific post-operative instructions to ensure a smooth recovery.

## Week-by-Week Timeline
To help you navigate through the healing process, here's a week-by-week timeline to set your expectations:

| **Week** | **Expected Recovery Milestones** |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| 1        | Rest, manage swelling, follow-up appointment |
| 2        | Begin light activities, reduced bruising |
| 3-4      | Gradually return to normal activities, fading bruises |
| 5-6      | Resume regular exercise, continued improvement |

## Do's and Don'ts
### Do's
- **Rest and Elevate**: Keep the surgical area elevated to minimize swelling.
- **Hydrate**: Drink plenty of water to support your body's natural healing mechanisms.
- **Follow Instructions**: Adhere to all post-operative guidelines provided by your surgeon.

### Don'ts
- **Avoid Strenuous Activities**: Refrain from heavy lifting or intense exercise until cleared by your surgeon.
- **Don't Smoke**: Smoking can impede healing and increase the risk of complications.
- **Limit Sun Exposure**: Protect your healing skin from direct sunlight to prevent pigmentation changes.

## Managing Common Side Effects
Swelling, bruising, and minor discomfort are common side effects after plastic surgery. Using cold compresses can help alleviate swelling, and prescribed pain medications can manage discomfort. If you experience any unusual symptoms, it's crucial to contact your surgeon promptly.

## When to Call Your Surgeon
Knowing when to seek medical advice is vital. Contact your surgeon if you experience severe pain, excessive swelling, signs of infection such as fever or redness, or any other concerns that seem out of the ordinary.

## Long-term Care Tips
Post-surgery care doesn't end after the initial recovery phase. Long-term care is vital for maintaining your results and overall health. Regular follow-up appointments, a healthy lifestyle, and diligent skincare can prolong the benefits of your procedure.
