      Very professional staff! I always feel welcome. I love how Tysharra is thorough and takes her time. She always explains all procedures and medications. She is very knowledgeable and pleasant. Not only are they professional, but the treatment is effective and I have lost 15 pounds so far! I would highly recommend this company.
