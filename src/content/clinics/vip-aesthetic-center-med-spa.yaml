      I had an amazing experience at this aesthetic dermatology clinic. From the moment I walked in, Trinity (the office manager) made me feel completely comfortable and cared for. Yami (the clinician) took the time to really listen, explain my options, and answer all my questions. The treatments were professionally done, and the results over time exceeded my expectations. The office is spotless, modern

      I can’t say enough good things about VIP! I came in for Botox and laser hair removal, and the entire experience exceeded my expectations. The team is incredibly knowledgeable, warm, and genuinely invested in helping you feel your best.  My Botox results are perfect—smooth, subtle, and super natural. The injector took the time to listen to what I wanted and delivered exactly that. I feel refreshed

      Very disappointed with their customer service. I was misled by a confusing Groupon offer. When I called ahead, the front desk employee acknowledged the error and assured me they would honor the lower price. However, once I arrived, I was told they would NOT honor it and was required to pay the price difference. This felt like a classic bait-and-switch situation, so of course I decided to leave and

      I got Revanesse Versa and I couldn’t be happier with my results. The injector was extremely knowledgeable, gentle, and took the time to explain everything step by step, which made me feel very comfortable. My lips look natural, hydrated, and perfectly balanced exactly what I wanted.  There was minimal swelling, the process was smooth, and the space was clean and professional. I truly appreciate th
