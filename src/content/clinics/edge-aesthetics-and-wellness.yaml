      Highly recommend! I had never had any injectables done in my face. I was always so scared but Ebonee took the time to talk to me, educate me and make me feel really confident and calm! She assured me a natural and painless experience and that is exactly what she delivered! She will be the only person i allow to touch my face!

      Ebonee is truly an amazing educator.  Her passion for what she does and her dedication to helping others shines through in every interaction. She is professional, approachable, and truly takes the time to listen. On the aesthetics side, she was attentive to my concerns and never pushed me beyond my comfort zone. On the wellness side, it's refreshing to have women providers who not only understand
