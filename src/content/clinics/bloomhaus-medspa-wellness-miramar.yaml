      I got laser sessions on my underarms and chin at Body Láser Medical and I was really happy with the results. I also did dermaplaning and loved how my skin turned out. The place is super cute, clean, and very organized. The attention from the owners was amazing, they’re so sweet and made me feel really comfortable. Totally recommend!

      I had Botox done at Body and Laser with Moira and couldn’t be happier! The staff was professional, welcoming, and explained everything clearly. The treatment was quick and virtually painless, and I love the natural results—fresh and rejuvenated without looking “overdone.” I’ll definitely be coming back!
