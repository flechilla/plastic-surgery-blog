      Wonderful first time experience. Ms. Evelyn was amazing, and made me feel so relaxed. I fell asleep y’all lol. She was great, all around and I will definitely be back for another visit. If anyone is in need of a facial technician, I recommend you visit. The ladies there are awesome, attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly. I am now a loyal customer.

      Took my daughter for her first underarm wax ever and Mrs. Alique did great. Very attentive, made my daughter feel comfortable. Walked her through everything, asked questions to ensure she was good throughout the process. Very professional and would highly recommend. Thank you 💕
