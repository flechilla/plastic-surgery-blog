      I am super happy to have had this service done with Lady Bella's med Spa. Personally, I was very anxious to recover my figure after having had 3 babies. I had the Bella shape done and I looked better than before. Alexandra has magical hands and she really gave me excellent service. The most important thing was she was honest with me and helped me. During all the process.

      My cousin's results after lipo 360 and a vertical abdominal scar revision are incredible. Alex is amazing. She has a knack for knowing what techniques to use (ultrasound, hand massage, wood therapy) and when to use them to achieve superior results.
