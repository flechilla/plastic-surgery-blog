      I absolutely love coming to Venus Medspa because of the exceptional service I get every time for years!!!  Jessica couldn’t be sweeter and more helpful when making appointments! She’s always so upbeat and kind and goes out of her way to call me if there are specials or certain skin care products that come in. Lisa is the nurse practitioner/injector who is probably one of the best!! It’s so importa

      Lisa ♛ is THE BOTOX professional of South Florida, Hands down. ★★★★★ if I could give 10 stars I would ! Botox®, Dysport®, Daxxify,: had all of them.  I have been to many places from Atlanta to Aventura; I would say i have experience with Neurotoxins services.  My last injection was so awful I assumed I became immune to neurotoxins :o).  I am beyond trilled that i got it done at Venus once again.

      This location is amazing! I’ve been here twice with Lisa and she is absolutely great. I’ve done one syringe in my lips each time and she works with me to get the exact look and shape I’m going for. Lisa corrected a slight droop I had on one side of my lip and she also fixed my lip from going up on one side when I would talk. These are things I didn’t expect to be fixed with lip injections since I

      Venus med spa is beyond fabulous. The staff is so sweet and knowledgeable. Jessica at the front desk was warm and welcoming. Answered all my questions with ease. Lisa, the injector is by far the best I’ve ever used. Gentle, knowledgeable, caring. I could go on and on. Life long client here and I’d refer them to anyone.
