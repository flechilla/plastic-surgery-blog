      I’m am so happy with my decision on coming to Bella Spa. This was my first time here. I came in for Botox/dysport. She was so informative. I have learned so much about my skin and what to do in the future to get the results I am wanting. I can’t express enough how happy I am that I found this spa. I definitely will be back. I’m a life long client now. Highly recommend!!!

      The best for everything! Getting to know Yasmeily has been life changing. I came here for Botox and then came back for a chemical peel. For years I have been exhausted and unable to focus.

She is so knowledgeable and a jo

      When I first came in, I told her i wanted botox but nothing noticeable, and we talked for a while until she told me that she does it on herself. I also explained about my past experiences with chemical peel and she told me about lasering, and how she also does that herself- and her skin looks amazing and smooth, which was proof to me that it works.  I was incredibly nervous about doing it but she

      I had a wellness visit with Yasmeily because I was experiencing significant symptoms. As a 38-year-old man who is active and in good shape, I was surprised to feel so exhausted, fatigued, and low on energy. I also lost interest in sex, felt foggy and unmotivated, and preferred to stay on the couch. My belly was protruding more than usual, and I was experiencing headaches. After reviewing my lab re
