      Chantel was amazing I absolutely love her! Super informative! I loved the spa !!! I had an injector I used for your straight, but she ended up moving away, so I needed to find a new place and stumbled upon this Medspa- Typically, I’m nervous to try new Medspa’s with new injectors because they try to push a bunch of Botox on you and I definitely did not get that here. That was definitely one of my

      Sustained deep scar tissue bumps on my inner lips because of this place, will never go back.  BEFORE/AFTER, SCAR TISSUE/FILLER POCKETS, AND POST ATTACHED❗️  I went in for a fill in October, 0.5 mL.

      I’ve been here multiple times hoping that I could get optimal results. Started getting lip filler about 6-8 months ago. It turned super lumpy so we dissolved. Refilled because uneven. Lumps came back. Dissolved one side but not the other. Came back because the other side that wasn’t dissolved became uneven. Why didn’t we dissolve both sides to make even in the first place and keep price lower for
