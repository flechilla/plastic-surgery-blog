      The salon is very clean and the service is good. But most of all I want to recommend the best person in this salon - Erika. She gave me back my faith in cosmetology.

      My first time getting Botox, so I was very nervous but Erika explained everything and made me feel completely comfortable. The results were amazing and I went back for seconds and will continue to see her. Very flexible with evening and weekend appointments which is so helpful.
