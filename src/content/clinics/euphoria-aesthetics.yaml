      I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend this clinic; besides being clean and fragrant, the environment is very pleasant and beautiful. The professionals work very well, and I was seen at the scheduled time without any delays. I confess I was afraid the treatment would be painful, but the equipment is excellent, and I didn't feel any pain even in very sensitive areas. Excellent, 10/10!

      I have been seeing Oni for my laser hair removal for 5 months now and she is amazing! It was the first time I had ever done it so I really appreciated her thorough explanation and slow approach to make sure we found the perfect setting for my laser sessions in the beginning. She is very detail-oriented so I know all hairs are really being targeted. On top of that, she’s also so friendly and kind.

      I tried the Smart Gym EMS at Euphoria and I’m already feeling the results! The space itself is really cute and has such an upscale, good-energy vibe. Everyone who works there made me feel super comfortable and taken care of. Will definitely be coming back!
