      Claire is great! I have been using Claire's expertise for fillers/Botox/laser tattoo removal for years and years!!!! I love her space and the personalized attention I get every time! I never feel rushed. She is great at saying NO when I am feeling a little overboard. I may want more lip filler but she is great at telling me " no! You will look like a duck!" She's the best!

      update: attached screenshots of the communications. Not once have I received a call back or response... and then, cherry on top, Ms. Claire canceled my appointment 20 mins before its scheduled time. I am in awe. I hope the owner of this business will learn about customer service. I rarely go out of my way to talk negatively about a business, but this one was just beyond disrespectful and the denia
