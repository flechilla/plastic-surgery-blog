      Went to Model Citizen for some Botox and filler - the shop is beautiful with an enclosed glass room. Exceptionally clean and bright and everyone who works there greets you with a smile. Sivan did my injections and was so light handed and precise that i barely felt anything with no bruising. I will continue to give them my business every time!
