      Dr Blackwell has operated on my breast tumor in the past and recently helped me through another scare with a mass and calcifications. She is a jewel!  She listens carefully, explains tests and alternatives well, and above all she genuinely cares about her patients. I feel extremely lucky to have her guide me through all the steps in the breast tumor journey.

      I have had the pleasure of knowing Dr. Leah Blackwell for over a decade, during which time she served as my breast surgeon for a benign lumpectomy.  I was referred to see her again for monitoring.Her positive demeanor significantly enhanced my confidence, and her lively personality is truly commendable.
