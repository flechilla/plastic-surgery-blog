      I had my surgery with Dr. DeLuca, I got chin lipo and Lipo 360 with fat transfer to the hips and I am so happy with my experience. The team was kind, knowledgeable, and made me feel supported before, during, and after surgery. My healing process went really well and I love my results. I’m so glad I chose this clinic, I would definitely recommend them 😁
