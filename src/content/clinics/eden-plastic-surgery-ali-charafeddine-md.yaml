      I cannot say enough good things about Dr. C and his whole team. Many others have written this before me, and it's so true: The second you step into his office, you feel comfortable and at ease and like you're part of a family. The surgery went really well, the after care was phenomenal and I was so impressed by how quickly every question was answered – even on weekends and holidays. I am super hap

      It is impossible to describe how amazing Dr. C and his team are!  From the minute you walk in you are welcomed like family.  Every single person was enthusiastic and uplifting. I have never met a practice with such professionalism and care!!! I can promise you if he cannot fulfill your expectations he will not do your work.  How often do you find a physician with that integrity.  I was truly bless

      I had the Evelift, PRP, fat transfer, and Co2 Laser done with Dr. Charafeddine January 5th and I cannot tell you how wonderful he and his team were. Dr C. is so professional and warm and precious at the same time. His confidence exudes, as it should, but in an humble way.  I studied many plastic surgeons on many platforms and chose him almost a year ago. His work was astounding! His team is so att
