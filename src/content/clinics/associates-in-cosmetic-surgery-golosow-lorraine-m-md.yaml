      Wow…I have had such an incredible experience with Dr. Lorraine Golosow and her team! My first visit was to discuss a breast reduction and lift.

      Dr. Golosow and her staff were not only extremely prompt in arranging to see me within two days of my MRI  findings but took the time at each office visit and at the time of my surgery to thoroughly explain everything. I was also extremely pleased with the Surgery staff at the Sanctuary and highly recommend Dr. Golosow. M. Wood

      Dr. Golosow performed my reconstruction after my double mastectomy.  She was very helpful, knowledgeable and her staff was always there for extra questions by phone call or at appointments.  Overall, my experience was flawless, and I would go back to her for any other needs.
