      Please don’t waste your time going to that place. They are very unprofessional. I went for a keloid injection the lady was talking about me in another language with her co-worker. Thank god I speak Spanish I understood what she said and take my business somewhere else. Do your self a favor go to a dermatologist.

      Wendy was personable and professional!!  I felt very comfortable and satisfied with the care she provided.  The space was clean and well kept😁 I tend to be very observant of cleanliness especially since I’m in healthcare myself.  She used good aseptic techniques and I felt comfortable with her touching my face. (I hate when professionals put gloves on while they’re in cabinets touching everything
