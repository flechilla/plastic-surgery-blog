      Both me and my husband went to Riverchase Dermatology for the first time. Dr Kera Browne was amazing. She made both of us feel welcome and well cared about. The young gentleman working the front desk gave you the same feel. The convenience of the of the office is a big plus. No more driving into Ft. Myers and all the traffic. If you live east of I75 this is the place for you. Search no more.

      I had a place on my ear for years. It finally started to stand up. It was removed; which I was thankful for. Everyone I spoke with was very kind and helpful. I will keep my year skin check each year. I was amazed with how fast the appointment and time spent in the office was so short.  Linda Burns
