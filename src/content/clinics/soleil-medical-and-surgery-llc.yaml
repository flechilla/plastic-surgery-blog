My surgeon was Dr Padilla an expert in (blepharoplasty or eyelid surgery ) he  made it a pleasant experience with no pain  and  I was back to work quickly.  Dr Padilla was great and the staff was wonderful.  Highly recommend.

      Dr. Max Padilla did an amazing job with my bulb eyelid removal. He was professional, thorough, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process. The results look natural and better than I expected. I’m extremely happy and highly recommend him!

      Dr. Padilla is the most calm and caring doctor.  He made me feel so comfortable and calm during my procedure (I get nervous with needles).
