      I had an amazing experience with Botox. Liz is wonderful — I absolutely loved her. I’ve been coming here for a long time for my treatments, and I always have a great experience. She is extremely professional, knowledgeable, and makes me feel comfortable every time. I truly love this place and highly recommend it.

      Today was my 5th session with Med Aesthetics Miami located in Aventura and for the fifth time I left the office very satisfied.

They are quick and efficient. Two of my friends recommended this place, and I recommend i
