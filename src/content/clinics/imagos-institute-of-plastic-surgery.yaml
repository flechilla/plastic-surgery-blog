      If I could give them 10 stars I would!! I’m long overdue on this review since I’m 2months post op, I had a breast augmentation with Dr. Jose Perez Gurri and they’re absolutely perfect from the size and feel of them. They look so natural even my scar is so tiny and fading already I’m sure it will be gone in a couple months. He blessed me and I couldn’t be happier!! Monica and Yolanda have been noth

      I had my breast lift here and there are no words to describe what I feel. I felt safe. I felt heard. I felt like they cared. I felt like I mattered. Not just like any other patient. There is no better feeling than trusting your doctor with any cosmetic surgery. I will be forever grateful to the amazing doctor and staff.

      I had a breast reduction and lift with Dr. Perez-Gurri, and the experience was amazing. He and his staff made me feel completely comfortable from day one. They took their time to explain everything and made sure I felt confident going into surgery. The attention to detail and care I received were outstanding, and I’m thrilled with my results. Highly recommend!

They look almost identical to my natural ones — only bigger and heavier — and I now have stretch marks and thin skin from the weight.  Another surgeon confirmed the implant p

      Wow I completely 10/10 recommend going here for breast augmentation. I moved to Miami by myself from Chicago so I don’t have much support out here but everyone made me feel so welcomed and comfortable from start to finish. Dr. Perez- Gurri is literally the sweetest most comforting surgeon and the whole staff is literally so kind and caring. Not to mention my results are so natural looking and I’m
