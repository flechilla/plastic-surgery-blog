      Dr Kazim has exceeded my expectations and is the only doctor I now see for skin care related to Botox and any fillers patients may desire. She is kind , cares about her patients as well as talented, knowledgeable and precise. Dr Kazim discusses in detail my expectations and never makes me feel she is short on time. She even follows up after my appointment to make sure the results are good and if a

      Dr. Kazim is an excellent physician with many years of experience. She transformed my life with the results of my eye lids surgery. I feel and look years younger. She's a true professional and her office staff are super nice and knowledgeable. I recommend Dr. Kazim and encourage everyone to go see her.

      I had upper eyelid surgery with Dr Kazim. She thoroughly explained what the surgery does and what it doesn’t do (e.g., it’s not a brow lift). She was professional, warm, and pleasant at every step of the way. The people in the office were great. Not a single complaint. Very happy with the outcome.
