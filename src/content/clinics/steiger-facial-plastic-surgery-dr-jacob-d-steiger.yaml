Every single person on the staff has been amazing from my first consultation all the way through post-surgery care. They made me feel comfortable, informed, and cared for every step of the way. Special shoutout to Luz and Barbara, who were

From start to finish, everything was seamless. Dr. Steiger is not only highly skilled and professional, but also such a kind and genuine person. His entire team truly cares and made us feel comfortable every step of the way. We recommend hi

      Dr. Steiger is exceptional! I had developed hereditary under eye bags in my early thirties, and they were all I saw when I would look in the mirror. I always looked tired. So at 34, I had a lower bleph and fat transfer with Dr. Steiger. The results beyond exceeded my expectations, and that is a lot coming from me! So happy that I decided to go ahead with the surgery and choose Dr. Steiger as my su
