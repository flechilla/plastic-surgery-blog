      Dr. Conde Green is amazing! She performed a lobuloplasty (earlobe repair) after years of wearing heavy earrings, and the results are beautiful. She’s talented, kind, and down to earth—she explained everything clearly, followed up after surgery, and truly cares about her patients. Her Boca Raton office is gorgeous and easy to get to. I couldn’t be happier and highly recommend her!

      Dr. Alexandra Condé-Green is excellent. Her approach and calmness makes any procedure a breeze. She wanted to ensure a successful and smooth approach for me who is a little anxious with procedures. She speaks multiple languages which was also helpful.  Her clinic was inviting, clean and bright. I was very pleased with my experience and would highly recommend her.

      Dr. Green saw my son when he was in the hospital with a hand injury in Boca. The hospital told us he needed to be seen by a hand specialist before being released. Dr. Green told us his hand was fine. - just swollen. Thank God we followed up with a true hand specialist a few days later because he had 3 tendons severed and needed immediate surgery. Her office sent us a $650 bill for the misdiagnosis
