      Forever Young and Trim is staffed with a professional, helpful, and friendly staff. Tania and Christine assisted me in my visits. They both took their time in explaining to me every option and were extremely thorough in addressing my concerns. They were instrumental in allowing me to make an informed decision regarding my treatments. I’m happy with my results and would recommend Forever Young and

Christine is great with me and loved how she always had a smile on her face and super sweet. I most definitely recommend this office.

      The doctors and staff are exceptional.  I have gone to the Plantation office and utilized the services of Dr. Michael Rodriguez as well as services from the trained staff over the last 7 years.  I have been pleased with everything both he and the staff have done for me.  I highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a caring and highly professional experience.

The next morning an hour before my appointment I get a call from a person who could hardly talk. She said she w
