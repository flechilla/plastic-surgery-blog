      I am incredibly thankful to Dr. Earle and the entire Pure Plastic Surgery team for making my experience the best it could be. I underwent a BBL reduction and reshaping, and even at just five days post-op, I can already see a beautiful difference.

In recovery I was welcomed with a small village of women that helped me with everything and it felt so good to have the feeling that I was in good hands
