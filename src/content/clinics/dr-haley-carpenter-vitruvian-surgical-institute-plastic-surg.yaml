      I had a double mastectomy with reconstructive surgery with Dr. Carpenter, and from the moment I began my search, it became clear that I simply couldn’t not choose her. She came highly recommended by multiple physicians, and after meeting her, I understood exactly why…she was absolutely worth the wait. Her bedside manner is truly exceptional. She took her time with me, answered every question I cou

What really stood out was how intuitive and kind she is. She asks the right

      I happened Dr. Carpenter by a fluke. I was visiting my surgeon at Baptist Boca for some back issues and he recommended her for my nerve issues. She is absolutely THE most thorough Dr. I have met in years. She takes her time, asks myriad questions, is caring, and wants to gets to the root problem. It's super refreshing! In fact, her staff is trained equally well and is welcoming, friendly, and resp
