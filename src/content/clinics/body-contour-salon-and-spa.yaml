      What a great way to spend my layover! With the chaos of trying to prepare for vacation I didn't have the time to get my nails done prior to leaving. Body Contour Salon And Spa was very courteous and all the workers were great. My nails turned out great and we finished just in time for me to catch my flight!

      From the first day consult the team here was nothing short of wonderful. They were detailed and informative in mapping out the right plan for the results I was looking for post op. I am grateful to have been referred here. Through their careful treatment I’ve been able to achieve the results I want and now continue to come regularly for touch ups. Do yourself a favor and book a consultation here,

      What a horrible waste of time. Cant speak for the service, but hear me out. Booked a 400$ worth of services. Came at 1pm sharp for my appointment. Was told she is running a bit late. Which is fine, we are all human. After about 20minutes, got asked to go use one machine for 10min and drink a cup of water later. Which i did. Came out and there was noone. Then finaly the lady came out again at 1:50.
