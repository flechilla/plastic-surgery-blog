      I had an excellent experience at Lumiere Med Spa getting my eyebrows done. The staff was professional, attentive, and took the time to shape my brows perfectly to complement my features. The spa itself is beautiful, very clean, and has such a calming atmosphere that makes the entire visit enjoyable. I really appreciated the attention to detail and the care throughout the service. I am very happy w

      The place has a super peaceful and lovely atmosphere, and from the moment I arrived, they made me feel very comfortable. The therapist was very professional, listened to my needs, and worked gently yet effectively.  It's so nice when a massage not only relaxes you but truly makes you feel good. I would definitely return and highly recommend it.
