      I had a great experience getting my wisdom teeth removed here. The staff is very friendly and helped me stay calm, and the procedure was quick with no pain. The healing process went smoothly and they even do a follow up to make sure everything is okay. I would definitely recommend!

      great experience from the staff when getting my wisdom teeth out!! even with an infected tooth, minimal pain and discomfort. slept the whole time and was out in an hour.  all of the receptionists are very personable and nice. the doctor is very informative and i like how they have two locations in either direction of me.
