      I had my first visit with Dr Shalhub and it was an absolute pleasure. Dr Shalhub and his assistant, Carolina, addressed all my concerns with great care and professionalism. All the staff I interacted with, from front desk to payments, were very nice as well. As someone who has to see a dermatologist with some frequency, I am glad to have found this office.

      Dr Shalhub has a wealth of experience and knowledge in treating different skin types.  We honest and won’t try to sell you laser procedures if he believes it will have negative affect. He listens to patient concerns, answers questions and determines a plan to treat the problem.  No issues with office or insurance.  No long wait times
