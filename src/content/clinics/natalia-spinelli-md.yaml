      If I could give Dr. Spinelli ten stars, I absolutely would! This was my first surgery, and I could not have asked for a better surgeon or experience. I used to believe that the best surgeons often lacked good bedside manner, but Dr. Spinelli is truly the total package. She is not only highly skilled and knowledgeable, but also incredibly kind, compassionate, and attentive. From start to finish, sh

      Dr. Natalia Spinelli is an awesome breast doctor. She makes you feel comfortable in scary times. Her office personnel are great too. Waiting time was short. I highly recommend Dr. Spinelli for any breast concerns.

      Dr. Spinelli is the kindest, happiest surgeon I’ve ever had.  She was a joy.  ALMOST worth getting breast cancer again.  Loved her but not that much.  She got all the cancer and I don’t have to have chemo or radiation.  I only have to take a hormone pill for the next 5 years and see the Oncologist every 6 months.  Thank you, Dr. Spinelli!!!
