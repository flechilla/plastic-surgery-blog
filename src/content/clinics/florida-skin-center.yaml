      Tamara was excellent!! Took not only my situation for my visit into consideration but was able to see there were other contributing factors. We need more providers like her! Thank you for your help and support.

      Dr.Badia is the best! She is always very helpful and listens and addresses my concerns. She offers treatments and finds areas that are suspicious. She is happy to follow up each time I  see her.  I look forward to seeing her familiar face and her expertise each time.
