      I would give zero stars if I could. This office is only interested in cosmetic procedures like Botox and facials, not actual dermatology care. When I called for a medical issue, they made me wait two weeks just to call me back, only to tell me the first available doctor’s appointment would be in March (and this was at the end of September). That’s a six-month wait for someone with a real skin conc

      Every 5 month visit Lisa Tack and Meaghan at Rendon Dermatology. Keeps me in good form, and keeps the face from aging. Ms. Tack is quite skilled with a syringe, and proper placement of filler. Feel five years younger every visit. Howard K Boca Raton.

      Dr. Lisa Tack and her staff were courteous, professional and efficient in every respect. They consistently deliver the highest quality care to their patients. The location is great and the facilities are immaculate (cleanliness etc). I would highly recommend this practice group to all comers!

Dr. Reed thinks about her patients first and explains everything like the professional she is. Other doctors should emulate how she is with her patients. I highly recom

      The doctors, PA’s, medical assistants and staff at Rendon are always welcoming. The environment is comfortable and professional. My needs are always met and listened to by PA, Lisa Tack, and/or Dr. Chere Lucas Anthony. I am grateful for all the staff that is always helpful and willing to assist in any way.
