      I had a laser hair removal treatment at No Filter, and I’m so happy with the experience! The staff was professional, friendly, and made me feel comfortable from start to finish. The procedure itself was quick and much less painful than I expected. My skin feels smooth, and I can already see great results. Highly recommend this spa for anyone looking for safe and effective laser hair removal!

      I just did the quantum rf at no filter medspa in brickell. I was really nervous to do this procedure but I really wanted to tighten my neck and inner thighs with out the need of surgery or lipo so I put my fear aside and went all in. I can’t recommend no filter enough the staff and the facility passes every expectation I had. The procedure was PAINLESS and I already see results.

      No Filter is hands down my go-to for everything beauty. The owner makes you feel like family and takes the time to really understand what you’re hoping to achieve. Every nurse here is a perfectionist—detail-oriented and so talented. I love that I always leave looking like myself, just more polished and refreshed. They know how to enhance your natural features so the results are beautiful without e
