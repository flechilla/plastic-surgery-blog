      Dr. Casey was very nice and made me safe and comfortable including everyone in the operating room. I would mention them, too but I never got their names. They all did an amazing job.  Sincerely, Jaime Resendiz

      I had a wonderful experience at the Bonita Office. The staff and Doctor were the best crew I've ever interacted with.

Thank you Dr. Casey and the rest of the team! Tomorrow will be day 7 of happy healing.
