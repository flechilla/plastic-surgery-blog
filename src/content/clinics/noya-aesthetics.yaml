      I had the best experience with Noya. She was incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and made me feel so comfortable throughout the entire process. She really took her time to make sure the results were to my liking. My lips turned out natural, plump, and exactly what I wanted. Her attention to detail and ability to listen to my goals really set her apart. I highly recommend her.

      Noya is the BEST!! It was the first time my sister and I were getting lip injections so we had a few questions leading up to the appointment and before injecting and Noya clarified everything and made sure we were comfortable. She was so kind and delicate and my lips look amazing and healed so beautifully I can’t wait to go back💘
