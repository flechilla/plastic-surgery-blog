      I had such a great experience at Pines Esthetics. Lauren is truly the best! She took her time, explained everything clearly and delivered amazing results. You can tell she really cares about her clients and knows exactly what she’s doing. On top of that the pricing is super reasonable for the quality of service you get. I left feeling confident and refreshed. Highly recommend booking with Lauren i

      I’m so grateful my mom recommended this place! I’ve been coming here since October/November and couldn’t ask for a better experience. All of the staff are truly the sweetest and so personable. I’m always greeted so kindly and taken care of by the best hands. I love all of the services and packages they offer. This is hands down my favorite place to be pampered. I would 100% recommend coming here.

      I’ve been to Pines Aesthetics in Coral Springs a few times and truly recommend them. They offer a variety of treatments and are competitive with pricing/bundle deals. The facials leave my skin feeling smooth and clean. I’m really satisfied with how healthy my skin looks and others have noticed the improvement. Must give them a try as you won’t regret.
