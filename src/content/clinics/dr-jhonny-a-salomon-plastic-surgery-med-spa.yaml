      Dr. Johnny Salomon truly made a life-changing difference in my surgical journey. From the very beginning, he made me feel comfortable, heard, and completely at ease. He took the time to explain everything clearly and always made sure I understood each step of the process. The nursing staff were just as amazing kind, attentive, and incredibly supportive. I never once felt anxious or alone, and that

      My name is Ramin. I traveled to Miami to have my surgery with my dear friend, Dr. Jhonny Salomon. I had a facelift, neck fat grafting, CO2 laser, and rhinoplasty. From the first moment, the experience in his office was amazing. The staff is very professional, kind, and attentive. They make you feel safe, calm, and very well taken care of. Even now, while I am still healing, I can already see wonde

      Dr Jhonny Salomon is absolutely amazing!!! I would recommend him to anyone! I flew from Seattle to Miami to have him replace and upgrade my 27 year old breast implants and it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.  His attention to detail was impeccable. The results are better than I had wished for!!!  Dr. Salomon thank you from the bottom of my heart for a successful surgery and recovery.
