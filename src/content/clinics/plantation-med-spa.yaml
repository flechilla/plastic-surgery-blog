      I came with my two girlfriends today to get our lips done with Lisa and she was a literal dream to be injected by. She's so meticulous and truly a perfectionist which is what you want when it comes to your injector. She's truly an artist with everything she does and my lips have never looked better. It was my girlfriends first time and she made the experience as relaxing and easy as possible which

      I had an amazing microneedling experience at this med spa, and Angie was absolutely wonderful. She was knowledgeable, professional, and made me feel completely comfortable from start to finish.

I’m very happy with my results

      I absolutely love Plantation Med Spa, I have their monthly membership and it is so worth it. I can’t say enough wonderful things about my esthetician, Angie. Every visit is such a great experience, and she truly goes above and beyond to make my skin look and feel its best.  I’ve had micro-needling, the Korean facial, and dermaplaning done with her, and each treatment has exceeded my expectations.

      Thank you to Rosa for recommending this place and to enroll in the VIP membership. And also I want to thank Angee for her patience, kindness and expertise during my treatments. It’s only been one session but I’m already feeling so much more confident! Best decision I’ve made this year so far 😊
