      I am sharing my experience with AirSculpt Beverly Hills so others can make an informed decision.  I paid approximately $20,000 for an AirSculpt procedure on my calves, knees, ankles, and inner and outer thighs after being told it was minimally invasive, had a 1–3 day recovery, and—most importantly—that any necessary revision would be performed with no additional fees. I specifically asked about re

      I recently had AirSculpt on my arms with Dr. Kandice, and the entire experience was so much easier and more comfortable than I ever imagined. I was awake, relaxed, talking, and listening to music and enjoying the Miami skyline — truly zero pain and zero stress. I went back to work the next day!  When I took my garment off for the first time, I could already see the difference. At one week, the cha

      I just had an AirSculpt procedure done and couldn’t be happier with my experience. The process was smooth, professional, and far more comfortable than I expected—and I was back at work the very next day, which honestly amazed me.  Dr. Kandace was absolutely incredible: knowledgeable, reassuring, and clearly an expert at what she does. She made me feel confident and cared for every step of the way.

      I am extremely disappointed with my experience at AirSculpt.  I underwent chin liposuction with Renuvion after being explicitly told during my consultation that I was a good candidate, that a single procedure should deliver satisfactory results, and that a second procedure or retouch would not be necessary.  I fully complied with all post-operative instructions, including wearing the compression g

      Very disappointed with my AirSculpting experience. It has been three months and I have seen no results at all. If anything the scale has gone up. I am very active and was told my case would be simple with fast results but that has not been true. Before I paid the facility seemed great. After that I was passed to a different team that did not feel professional. You cannot speak to the doctor direct
