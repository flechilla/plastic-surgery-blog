      Dr. Pierre Gordon, in addition to his experience and knowledge, makes communication with his patients transparent and effective. He is an excellent professional, pleasant and concerned with providing the best care. My surgery was 7 weeks ago, there was a climate of trust, the care and the operation were a complete success. I am very happy and grateful with the results!

      My experience with Dr. Gordon  was excellent.  I had a tummy tuck under another surgeon and the treatment was the worst. Dr. Gordon was very personable. He made sure of my safety from the very start to the end.  He made sure I knew the process and was comfortable about the decision I made concerning the procedure. I am impressed with my results. Yes, if there is any procedure that I may want, Dr.
