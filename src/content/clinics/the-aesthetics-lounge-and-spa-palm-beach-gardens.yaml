      Jennifer  is truly one of a kind. She’s skilled, knowledgeable, and always up to date, but what sets her apart is how much she genuinely cares. She takes her time, never rushes, and never pushes anything you don’t need. She just wants you to look your best.

      Absolutely love the design of this place. Jen is obviously so experienced, honest, and kind. I was extremely comfortable and the process was painless. I got tox and lip filler. Obsessed w my results and can’t wait to come back.

      I’m so impressed with the T-Shape 2! I saw a noticeable change in my face after the first treatment, and my legs started improving by session six.

      Amazing service with Vanessa. Great pricing! I recently moved here and was very nervous about a new injector in a new place.

Luckily, my anxiety was put to ease when I walked into the Aesthetics Lounge. It was a de
