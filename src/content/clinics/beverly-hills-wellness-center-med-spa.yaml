      truly love coming to Beverly Hills Wellness Center & Spa. I’ve been a patient of Dr. Chadi for over two years, and I can honestly say my results are amazing every single time. He is so kind, friendly, and incredibly professional. He really listens and makes you feel comfortable, which means so much when you’re trusting someone with your face.  The spa is always clean, beautiful, and relaxing, and

      I absolutely love Beverly Hills wellness! Dr Dahabra is one of the absolute best injectors. His persuasion and placement with Botox or Xeomin is always amazing. His team is equally as talented. Shelia and Elle give the best facial’s, micro needling and dermaplane. I’ve been beyond happy with all of their services I have tried.

This is definitely not something I usually do, so I did my due diligence and researched a few places before choosing this med spa.  I’m glad I did.

They assisted me in selecting an appropriate IV given what I told them the issues were that I wanted to solve.  I know there are a ton of medspas popping up everywhere right now and frankly a lot of them are mediocre but this
