She made the entire process seamless and

      My experience at Take Shape Plastic Surgery was nothing short of fantastic. I got a double incision with free nipple grafts (Top Surgery). Stacey helped me navigate my payment plan with Cherry and was able to walk me through anything I needed assistance with, especially as a 20 year old who's never navigated anything like this before.  Dr. Sassani joined me and my very reluctant conservative mothe
