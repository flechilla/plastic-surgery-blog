      Facility is very clean and organized. Self check in Kiosks were nice and we were able to scan our insurance card right there. Everyone one was welcoming and nice, except Dr. Alvarez.

      I am so grateful to Dr Apara for the way he cares and communicates. He has performed three surgeries on my eyes. I have total confidence in him and his abilities. He cares for his patients with sincerity and kindness. I have a friend who is also a patient of his and she feels the same way. He is a blessing. I highly recommend him.

      Hello there, I experienced an eye infection after my visit with you on Wednesday in which took all my joy and attention during the Thanksgiving holiday. It is completely uncomfortable and painful. Not to mention that the lady who took my medical history wasn’t kind to say the least and been quite rude to learn that I am not taking any medications beside vitamins and one prescription. Thank you for

      I had to see Dr. Glassman in the Hollywood office for possible biopsy or injection in my eyelid, and the doctor and staff really could not have been better. They saw me quickly and everyone was very friendly, which helped because I was a little nervous. All the medical staff including Dr. Glassman explained everything in easy to understand terms, and patiently answered all my questions. No long de
