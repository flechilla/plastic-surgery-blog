      Dr. Miami and his team were amazing. They really made you feel welcomed and went out of their way for you. Thorough explanation on pre op and post op care. His care team was the best!

Amazing experience and looking forward to booking in the future! 🤍

      I truly recommend Dr. Miami for any cosmetic procedure. I recently had my first cosmetic surgery with him BBL, ab etching, and Lipo 360 and I am absolutely in love with my results. Not only were the outcomes amazing, but his entire team was incredibly kind, professional, and attentive. The all of the recovery nurses made me feel safe and well cared for throughout the entire process. Before choosin
