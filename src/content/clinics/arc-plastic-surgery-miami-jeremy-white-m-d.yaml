      Dr. White and his coordinator Ari are an unbelievable team.  Surprisingly (almost unbelievably), I had *no* bruising and minimal swelling coming out of surgery, which only proves how talented and patient he is as a surgeon. I had consulted with other ENT and cosmetic surgeons in the area, and I always felt rushed and as if they already knew/assumed what kind of changes I wanted without really lett

      Our family is deeply grateful to Dr. White for his exceptional care following our teenage son’s ice-skating accident, which resulted in a significant facial/lip injury. From the initial consultation to the post-operative follow-up, Dr. White demonstrated remarkable professionalism, precision, and compassion.  He clearly explained the treatment plan, set realistic expectations, and made our son fee

      I went to Dr. White seeking a little more youthful version of myself. I received much education on my face and neck lift procedure. My results have been amazing. My excess wrinkles and skin have been erased from my neck, my face looks exactly like myself minus no wrinkles. I’m so thrilled with Dr. Whites amazing work! I highly recommend him. I’ve attached Before and After pictures.

      We had a wonderful experience with Dr. White. Our newborn daughter needed ear molds, and as parents we were understandably nervous. From the very first consultation, Dr. White was kind, patient, and reassuring. He took the time to explain every step of the process, answered all our questions, and made sure we felt completely comfortable. The results have been amazing and the entire process was gen
