      Claudia is the sweetest most genuine person I’ve ever met. Since the beginning I felt very comfortable, I came in with no prior work and she helped guide me in the direction of the look I wanted but keeping it natural and doing it slowly. I can’t thank her enough on how gentle she was. She is very realistic and knowledgeable. She is very dedicated to her work and it shows. I will continue coming a

      From the moment I walked in to CG Aesthetics, I knew I made the right decision. Claudia is very knowledgeable and welcoming. I asked a ton of questions because I was a bit nervous as a newbie, but she was very patient and put my nerves at ease. Her suite is very clean and beautiful and her work ethic is incredible! I am hooked and look forward to my next appointments. She is amazing!!
