      Went to him after a friend of mine had him do her mommy makeover with fantastic results. I needed eye bags gone! I'm so happy with my results and don't think I look 51 anymore! Will be going to him for my tummy tuck next year!

      I had a breast augmentation a few months back with Dr Schneider and staff. It was a great experience and a great purchase! I am very happy with how the staff worked and how caring and friendly they are. Definitely made me feel comfortable with any questions or concerns I had. I am happy with how my breasts healed and definitely will recommend them!
