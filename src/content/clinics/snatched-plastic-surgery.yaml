      I'm 3 weeks post op from an abdominoplasty and full back and arm lipo. I chose Snatched for my surgery because I loved the results I saw online.  Doctor Gary Vela performed my surgery and he made me feel very safe and in good hands.  Wendy was mi coordinadora and I can't say enough good things about her, she has guided me and been there for me with no complaints. I felt understood by her.  The mas

Dr. Vela truly listened to what I wanted and delivered results that exceeded

Most of the girls spoke primarily Spanish and came across as stand offish and not very welcoming. The bedside manner could definitel

      i’m disappointed in my breast augmentation by doctor boulos. they’re so uneven, and looks like i barely got my boobs done. he didn’t pick the right size for me to correct my asymmetry and so my boobs continue to be uneven even after surgery. my main concern was boob size difference and i’m so sad that i spent my money at this clinic. will most likely have to get a revision down the road but going

      Results were amazing and staff was  kind but if you think you’re seeing the doctor after your surgery think again. I was told to come back two different times to see the doctor and both times he was “unavailable”. You would think a doctor wants to see his work and reassure his patients that all is well.
