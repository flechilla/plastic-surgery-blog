      I had my breast augmentation done here ..Im super happy with my results.  Very caring doctor.  Their clinic is very clean and sophisticated. I had my lip injection done here also. I wish I went here for my tummy tuck. I had awful experience from another doctor here in Fort myers. Highly recommend this place if u want cosmetic surgery.  You'll be happy as u can read the reviews.
