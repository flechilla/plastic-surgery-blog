      I couldn’t be happier with my results at Zion! I got a lipo 360 with a BBL and I got exactly what I asked for! I want to thank the entire staff from front desk to the operating room and to the young lady I spoke with in my initial first call for helping me and guiding me through the entire process. Any time I had a question they were helpful and patient with me. This clinic cares!!
