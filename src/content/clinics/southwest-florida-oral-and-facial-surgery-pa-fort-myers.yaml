      Dr Hogan and the team are top notch! I needed to have multiple teeth extractions. Needless to say, I was a bit nervous. They all made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. The procedure went very well. Everything was explained to me thoroughly. The healing process has been very smooth! Would highly recommend this group of professionals!

      I had an excellent experience at this oral surgery office and am very grateful for the care I received. From the moment I arrived, every staff member was kind, patient, and incredibly reassuring. I was extremely nervous going into my wisdom teeth procedure and was put to sleep with IV sedation, which I was very scared about. The entire team was amazing with me and never made me feel uncomfortable,

      My dentist, Dr. Felix recommended my appointment to have the lower teeth of mine extracted and have a temporary plate on the bottom, followed by full dentures in six weeks. Staff at Southwest Oral facial surgery are really outstanding. Warm and welcoming, making me easier. I did have some apprehension of pain and it was not the case at all. It was a first time I ever had a dentist, examine my teet
