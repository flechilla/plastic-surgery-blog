      Definitely going to be returning to Gilda. You can’t find someone more dedicated to helping you achieve your goals. I’ve been to many providers, but I was so surprised as to how much she cares to explain and educate who’s in her chair to make the best choice for them. Will be referring others here!

      I had a great experience at GM medical! Gilda was extremely helpful, patient, kind, understanding and nice. She is so knowledgeable and I’m so grateful that she explained the process to me and put my mind at ease regarding my appointment. I will definitely be back for other services as well because her kindness and the environment was so clean and welcoming. I am so pleased that I chose GM medical
