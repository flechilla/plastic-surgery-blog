      I went to Velvet Plastic Surgery for a chin lipo and the experience was top. Dr. Mario Reyes is truly the best in Miami ❤️. He made me feel comfortable throughout the procedure and the results are exactly what I wanted. The coordinator was super helpful, guiding me through every step. Really happy with how everything turned out! 🙏
