      Such a great experience!  I had been looking for Endermologie (LPG) for a while since I used it previously in another country. It is excellent for lymphatic drainage, skin tightening, and body contouring. Bielka actually has an upgraded version of the machine—even better than the one I used before—and I love it so much! It is more comfortable, has 3 different modes, and feels like a good massage.

      The facility is clean, modern, and very relaxing. The staff are true experts in their field, and I felt I was in the best hands possible the whole time. They guided me through my treatment with skill and delivered exceptional results.

      I really enjoyed my treatments with Bielka. She was always very friendly,  explained what and how endermologie works, and I always felt great after my treatments.  My clothes fit better, my shin was toned, and I will definitely recommend going in to see Her.

      I didn't know anything about endermologie, went for my first session, and Bielka explained everything to me.I signed up for the 12 session plan. I looked forward to our hour long treatment and the great conversation .It took a while to notice a difference. But I started to notice shorts that were tight felt loose. I'm heading home, im a snowbird, and going to look for somewhere that offers this se
