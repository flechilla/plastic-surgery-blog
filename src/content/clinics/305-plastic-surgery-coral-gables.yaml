      I have had the worst experience with this office recently. Dr. Brewsters direct office to be exact. I paid a deposit and booked a procedure through Nathalie with Dr. Brewster specifically back on November 4th. My scheduled surgery date is January 20th. Just yesterday, over a month after booking I received a text message, not even a proper phone call but a text message from his nurse named Willmary

      I had a breast reduction and lift with Dr. Nosrati on 12/15/2025 and I'm currently one day post-op. I love my new breast. He did an amazing job. I will be back in March for lipo 360. I can't wait to see him again. Dr. Nosrati has lovely bed side manner and is very efficient and effective with communication on your needs and he listens. Book with him immediately!!!!
