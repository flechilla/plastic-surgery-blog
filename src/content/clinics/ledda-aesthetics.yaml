      This was my first appointment with Ledda, I was impressed from the moment I stepped into her studio.  Extremely clean with the most modern equipment.  I had the dermabrasion / light peel facial.  She took  her time and did an excellent job!  The products she uses are light and natural, no burns, I left with hydrated and glowing skin!  I will be back!

      Ledda has been helping me to improve my skin, face,tummy, and neck. I love her work. I looked much younger after three treatments of Fractional Mi-croneedling RF Facial and order treatments. Her workplace was spotless. I will come back to see her for more help with different areas. I highly recommend it if you need help improving your skin. She is the one to thank you for your fantastic work. Trac
