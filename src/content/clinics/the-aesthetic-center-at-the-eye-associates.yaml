      Amy is amazing, very knowledgeable and super sweet. She addresses all concerns, Takes her time, and very detailed. The included massage is by far my favorite.

      The aesthetic center is A+. Dr. Yee performed my blepharoplasty which helped me tremendously.  I have ocular rosacea and coupled with excessively drooping eyes I had trouble seeing and my eyes itched constantly. Now I can see clearly and the itchy eyes hardly ever occur after Dr. Yee's top notch surgery.

      I'm a bit disappointed that there is zero follow up from anyone following surgery and then the laser corrective surgery.    Makes ECOF seem like a chop shop
