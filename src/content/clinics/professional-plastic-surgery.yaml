      I had my tummy tuck performed on January 16, 2026, and I am truly pleased with my results. The entire staff was amazing from start to finish. Dr. Pacheco was incredibly detailed and took her time explaining every part of the procedure to me. Her method of suturing is exceptional — you can hardly tell there’s a scar, it looks like a straight clean line. I saw the nurse the very next day, and she to

      I came from out of state and had a complete mommy makeover.bbl, tummy tuck with liposuction, breast lift. Let me just say, this was the best experience I could have ever asked for. The support and compassion I have continually received even after returning home has been incredible. Dr. Pacheco and her team are amazing people and I feel so blessed to be going through this journey with them.

      Professional Plastic Surgery was an excellent choice for my tummy tuck, liposuction, and body contouring. I had my surgery in July 2025 and intentionally waited to write this review so I could speak to the entire experience—from consultation to recovery—not just the procedure itself. My surgeon, Dr. Bella Pacheco, is truly phenomenal. She was honest, transparent, and thorough throughout the pre-op

      From start to finish they took very good care of me. It was harder being an out-of-town patient, but I know they did their best to answer all my questions and reassure me that everything was going great. Dr K and his staff made me very comfortable with the procedures and gave me great confidence on how I looked. Thank you to everybody at Professional Plastic surgery
