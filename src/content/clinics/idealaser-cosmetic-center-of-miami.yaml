      I love this place. The owner treats you like family and is very knowledgeable about your needs. I have done from laser hair removal to laser tattoo removal and to me they are the best. My hair has not grown back and it’s been like 10 years that i did it. The tattoo removal is a bit painful but Odalys takes her time to make sure you are not in pain and puts topical anesthesia for the eyeliner laser
