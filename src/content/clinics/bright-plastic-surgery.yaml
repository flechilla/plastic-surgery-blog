You all stay blessed and cont

      Amazing bedside manners from the office staff but I’m extremely grateful for the care I received from Milly the office post-op nurse, she always above and beyond to provide excellent, patient care. Dr. Brewster is an amazing surgeon and I love my results! From the moment I went in for my first consultation I always felt extremely comfortable and never doubted I was going to have an extremely succe
