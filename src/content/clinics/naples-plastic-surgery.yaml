      From the very first visit, everyone in the office made me feel comfortable. Dr. Baccaro listened to exactly what I wanted as far as results with my surgery. Very knowledgeable and professional. I am very happy with my results. The nurses on surgery day were so sweet and made me feel at ease. Every single person in the office is so nice and welcoming! I would recommend them to anyone!

      I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Walsh and the entire team at Naples Plastic Surgery. From my very first consultation through post-op care, I felt genuinely supported, informed, and cared for every step of the way.  I underwent a reduction and lift along with a preventative bilateral mastectomy, and from the beginning, Dr. Walsh approached my care with an incredible level of skill, c
