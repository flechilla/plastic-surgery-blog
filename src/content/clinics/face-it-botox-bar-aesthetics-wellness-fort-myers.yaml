      I’ve been a customer at FIBB for about five years, and I keep coming back! From regular Botox to other treatments I’ve tried, everything has given me natural, noticeable results. My goal has always been to stay youthful without surgery, and FIBB helps me do exactly that. Everyone is great — from the front desk to the techs and clinicians.

      If I could give six stars I would. Ryann was incredible!!!! 12/10 experience. Her knowledge, training, and consultation is unmatched. Not only is she highly trained to provide beautiful results but she’s also so kind and makes you feels so comfortable. I will definitely be going back and referring all friends and family to see her! Giving her all her flowers 👏🏼

      If I could give them 10 stars I would. Bea Jay does a fantastic job with my Botox. She alleviated all of my problem areas, and is very knowledgeable in explaining all your options in an understandable way. I wake up in the morning feeling better about starting my day and facing the world. I look forward to seeing her and the girls for my next appointment. Top notch customer service all around.

      My wife received a Moxy laser treatment from Krysta today and loved it. We have med spa shopped around  Naples and so far this seems to have all the services they represent. Which sounds silly, but you’d be surprised. The membership is more of a bank and gets us to set aside money each month to care for our skin which takes on the rays of the beautiful sun we enjoy. Classy!

      Another wonderful experience at FIBB in Punta Gorda. Highly recommend Hannah for microneedling as she is exceptional. The entire team exceeds expectations and so excited I don’t have to leave Punta Gorda to meet all my facial aesthetic needs.
