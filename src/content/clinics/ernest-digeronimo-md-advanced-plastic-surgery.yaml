      Life-Changing Experience!  From the moment I walked into the clinic, I felt completely at ease. The staff was incredibly welcoming, professional, and knowledgeable. Dr. DiGeronimo took the time to thoroughly explain every step of the procedure, answer all my questions, and made sure I felt confident in my decision.  The surgery itself went smoothly, and the recovery process was exactly as describe

      I am currently 4 weeks postop and I can say my experience with Dr. Digerimo was great . He was so down to earth and made me feel more comfortable before going into surgery. I’m glad I chose him as my surgeon. Very nice and knowledgeable guy !

Avoid this place if you value your health and peace of mind.
