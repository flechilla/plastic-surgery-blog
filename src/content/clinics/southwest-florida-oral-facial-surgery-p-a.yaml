      The doctor and his staff were wonderful.  I had to come see them after a botched wisdom tooth removal earlier in the day at another dentist.  The doctor and Selma knew my concerns with the needles (I was poked 9 times in the AM) and he said I have been doing this over 30 years - we got this.  I trusted him and the tooth was out in minutes.  No more pain.  Also no sutures or bone grafts (which firs

      Staff is on the ball and very nice, and the Dr was helpful, informative and friendly.  They were very transparent about the cost and reminded me that my next appointment in the new year will cost more due to having to meet the annual deductible.  They didn't have to tell me that and I appreciate it.  All in all, I may have to drive a while to get there but it's a place I highly recommend.

      Dr.Tejara and his help are first class. Dr.Tejara, if you ask around, has a reputation as simply the best oral and facial surgeon in the area. Naturally, I had a high expectations. And Dr.Tejara and staff exceeded those expectations. So do I recommend him? My feelings are very similar to that ending narration from my favorite television show in the 80's, "If you have a problem, if no one else can

      I don't like doctor's offices, it's a thing. This place was tolerable. Parking is easy and close to the office door. It was never crowded (went twice), the folks working here are polite and just really nice.  Dr. Brasileiro rocked. He worked fast and kept me calm and comfortable the entire time I was going through my surgery and this was the first time ever experiencing oral surgery for me, so I r
