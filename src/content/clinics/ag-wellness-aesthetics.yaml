      This is one of the very few reviews I have ever felt compelled to write. My experience at AG Wellness & Aesthetics was nothing short of incredible. From the moment you walk through the doors, every detail is meticulously taken care of. The ambiance is serene and calming, with everyone smiling and welcoming. My Daphene, was exceptionally knowledgeable. Although I've been using their IPL Hair Remova

      I’m glad I found AG wellness. They are truly the best medical spa in Pembroke Pines and all over south Florida. I did the facial skin treatment and best believe I’m going back again because I’m addicted. They have the friendliest staff and the best equipment. I definitely recommend if you’re looking for a fresh smooth skin 10/10
