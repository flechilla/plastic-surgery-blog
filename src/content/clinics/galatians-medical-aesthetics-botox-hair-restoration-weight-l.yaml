      Dr. Sasha is incredibly knowledgeable and skilled at what she does. Her injections are not painful and she talks you through the process, explaining everything as she does it. Not only that, but she takes time to educate you which is so important for maintenance and understanding the treatments. I recommend her to everyone.
