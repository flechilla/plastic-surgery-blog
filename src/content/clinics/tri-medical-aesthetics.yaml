      Had Dysport with Maria, it was amazing! She listened and answered all of my questions, taking the time to make sure I was comfortable. The actual treatment went so smoothly, best way to describe how she works is like a fairy! Wonderful.

      If you want clear radiant skin I highly recommend Tri Medical Aesthetics! Their treatments range from removal of facial veins, sun damage, wrinkles, scars, stretch marks and so much more! The staff is so lovely and welcoming. You won’t be disappointed!

      I had another amazing and relaxing experience at Tri Medical Aesthetics. Went in for a facial and Dermaplaning to help with the texture of my skin and left with super glowy and smooth skin. Emilie was so great and gave so much insight to the whole process! Would absolutely recommend :)

      My laser treatment is really working!! I’m on my 4th session and I barely need to shave now!! It’s such a great feeling. Everybody is so patient and professional there. I am so happy with my treatment.
