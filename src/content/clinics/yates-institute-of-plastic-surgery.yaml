      I was so nervous to have my first surgery performed. Something I wished for a very long time. I found out about Dr. Yates through Memorial HealthCare and she is absolutely phenomenal.

      I had a great experience getting a BA here. The staff are so kind and courteous. They care for your well-being and are responsive to your concerns. Dr. Yates is very knowledgeable and walks you through everything step by step. My nurse, Taylor, did a phenomenal job in all things pre and post op! I couldn’t be more happy in my experience and highly recommend it to anyone considering an operation.
