      Choosing Dr. Farber was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I’ve seen countless before and after photos, and they truly speak for themselves. His attention to detail and consistently stunning results immediately impressed me. Even before my first consultation, I knew I was in the right hands.  I am about three months post-op from my breast augmentation and lift, and I genuinely could not be

      Dr. Farber is a true perfectionist and an absolute ARTIST who clearly takes his craft seriously. He was my first and only consultation! His expertise and approach were convincing enough from the start. He radiates confidence. I had a breast lift, implant and internal bra. He was conservative and attentive throughout the entire healing process, checking in every step of the way and never rushing a

      I am just about one year post-op from my breast augmentation with Dr. Farber and I truly cannot say enough amazing things about him and his entire team. From my very first interaction with the office, they were incredibly kind, responsive, and attentive. Every question I had—big or small—was answered promptly and with genuine care.  My initial consultation with Dr. Farber was a 10/10. He carries s

      Dr. Farber is not just a surgeon, he's an artist. I've never worked with someone who cares more about his patients' outcomes and pays such attention to detail. My results were amazing and as this was an exchange and downsize, that's phenomenal. With the level of work he does, I think he should charge more.
