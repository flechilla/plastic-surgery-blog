      I have nothing but good things to say about Riverchase Ft Myers West.  I have beena patient for years, and they always take excellent care of me.  The staff is friendly and professional, Sady Rego is a delight to work with and always leaves me feeling as though any treatment and/or concerns have my best interests at heart.  My pups love Aunt Sady (and all the ladies)!

      10/10 experience !! Rory and his assistants are so kind and caring. After multiple surgeries done with them for dysplastic nevi spots, i can solidly say… they truly do the best job! They will talk to you through the procedure, keeping your mind off of it and easing any nerves. Rory is very gentle, knowledgeable, and thorough! Him and his team have a level of professionalism and compassion that is

      Went in for MOHs surgery. Dr. Pennycook explained the procedure and what I could expect in detail. The alternative to MOHs was also discussed. The entire office helped me to feel comfortable from beginning to end of the procedure. Even though I don't like surgery of any nature I left the office knowing I had the best of care and treatment.

      Start to finish I had a great experience. My appointment started right on time. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The young lady who was working with Dr Rory was phenomenal. She was very sweet and careful when administering the anesthetic. Made me feel 100% at ease. Dr Rory was quick and kept me updated with every step of the procedure.

      I have given 5 stars, but if I could’ve given them 10 stars, I would their services were fantastic. Dr. Patterson worked diligently and carefully on my husband and myself. We had two different concerns which were taken care of. He as well as all the staff, from the front desk and the medical assistants were very professional, respectful, friendly and friendly. Absolutely no complaints. I highly re
