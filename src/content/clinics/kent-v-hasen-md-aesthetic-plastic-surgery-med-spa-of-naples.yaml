      I’ve had a great experience with Dr. Hasen and his team.  I had a breast lift with implant, Lipo, and BBL in November 2025. The process has been smooth, and my results are very natural. Everything has been wonderful from beginning to end, and I would highly recommend choosing Dr. Hasen for your cosmetic surgery needs.

      Personnel are very professional and polite.  Knowledgeable and thorough in explaining procedures for me to follow.  My daughter had a good experience with this Doctor and has recommended him to have my nose straightened.  I'm confident Dr Kent V. Hasen will do a good job.
