      This was my very first experience with eyebrow laser treatment and it was amazing! I was a little nervous at the beginning because I was worried about the pain, but they applied anesthesia and made me feel completely comfortable. The whole process was done in such a professional and caring way, and the doctor is truly the sweetest. I’m beyond happy with my results — my eyebrows look incredible!  O

      I am a patient of Dr. Leticia Burgos I can say that the quality of the product and the method she uses to administer Botox are unlike anything I've ever seen in Miami. I wholeheartedly recommend her because qualified and dedicated professionals deserve all the recognition.

      I had an amazing experience getting my eyebrow tattoo removed! The process was completely pain-free, and Mari made me feel so comfortable and confident throughout. The results are already noticeable, and I couldn’t be happier with the care and professionalism. Highly recommend!

      Tattoo removal. Great quality! I love it. I did my first session and I already look natural. I need one or two sessions and I will definitely come back and suggest to come here to my friends.
