      I had a great experience at Mirar. I went in for Botox and lip filler before the holidays, and Dr. Yanetsi made the whole process feel easy and comfortable. She really listened to my concerns and together we came up with the best plan for me. She took the time to explain everything in detail.  My results look very natural—just refreshed, not overdone. It was exactly the kind of subtle refresh I wa

      Dr. Yanetsi is amazing! She is not only very skilled at what she does, but she also has such a caring and kind way with her patients. She really listens, makes you feel at ease, and takes the time to explain things so you never feel rushed. It’s rare to find a doctor who is both so knowledgeable and so genuinely compassionate. I feel lucky to be under her care and would recommend her to anyone!
