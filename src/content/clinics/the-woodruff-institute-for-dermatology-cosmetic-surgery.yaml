      The office staff and the doctor’s assistant are helpful, friendly, and professional. I felt comfortable throughout  the visit. Dr. Burton is one of the best dermatologist I have been to. He listened and addressed all my concerns and questions. He explained what and why he was doing.  I never felt rushed and feel confident in his ability to take care of my condition.  Highly recommend him and his s

      Have been going to The Woodruff Institute for several years now and find Dr. Churton to be a top notch dermatologist! In addition, their PA’s are also terrific as well as the front office folks. I highly recommend!

      Just had an appointment with Dr Churchton and she was amazing. She offered multiple treatment options to address my concerns and explained them to me. She answered all my questions and she didn’t seem like she was in a rush. She has great bedside manners and is very knowledgeable. Her assistant Stephanie was also very nice and efficient  as well as everyone I met that day in the office.

      After bad experiences in the area with dermatologist it was great working with Tiffany.  She was thorough and gentle. Took her time making sure she got to all my skincare concerns. I'll be back!

      The Woodruff Institute is excellent all the locations I’ve been to however the one in Bonita Springs on Walden Circle is very easy to get an appointment at and the staff there is outstanding. I called yesterday very late in the day for a refill on a prescription and when I checked my pharmacy this morning, it had already been called in by Karen at the office. Karen is an asset to your organization
