      A Great Experience with Dr. Robert Tomas, D.O. – Desarda Hernia Center, Fort Myers, FL  I had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Robert Tomas at the Desarda Hernia Center in Fort Myers, and I couldn’t be more impressed with the entire experience.

      I can only say that I received great care and attention from Dr Tomas and his entire team. From the very first consultation I knew I was in good hands. I am now well on the way to a full recovery from my inigual hernia surgery and will return to Europe shortly.  If you have a hernia I really recommend this doctor and his method of  not using synthetic materials like mesh. Whilst I was there I met

      I can’t thank Dr. Tomas enough for the amazing care he gave me during my hernia surgery. From the first appointment to my follow up visits, he was kind, patient, and reassuring. He took the time to explain everything and made me feel completely comfortable through the whole process. The surgery went perfectly, and my recovery has been smooth and easy all thanks to his skill and attention to detail

      Excellent experience with Dr. Tomas and everyone else on the staff. I saw Dr. Tomas for a small umbilical hernia. The initial consult was quick and easy. Dr. Tomas answered all of my questions and surgery was scheduled for two weeks later.  Surgery was quick and easy.

      Need a double hernia surgery. Went in alittle nervious but the staff put me at ease rather quickly. The doctor and the whole team did an amazing job. Surgery took about an hour and a half but w went as smoothly as a surgery can go.  Told me what to expect and suggested the Zynrelief for pain after the procedure.  I strongly recommend getting it.  I highly recommend him and his team.
