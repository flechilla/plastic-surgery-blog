      I had the best experience at Asha Medspa. From the moment I walked in, the customer service was exceptional and everyone treated me with so much care and kindness. I am currently pregnant, and they were extremely attentive and thoughtful, making sure I felt safe and comfortable at all times. They truly went above and beyond to take care of me. I had a facial cleansing for my face and back, and the

      I’ve been going to Asha for a year now, and I had never felt truly safe or confident getting facial treatments until I met the girls there. From day one, they’ve been incredibly kind, very professional, and always so careful with every treatment. They make me feel completely comfortable, answer all my questions with patience, and consistently provide exceptional care. Truly the best.

      Asha Medspa has to be my favorite place now! It felt so heavenly.. My skin is sensitive, I am picky when it comes to skincare or facials or anything face related. My skin feels SO good after my personalized treatments. Staff are super nice and friendly! It felt like I have been there before. Don’t think about it twice, just book and enjoy the experience. Thank me later!

It feels like finding a place where you’re truly understood, listened to, and where they analyze your skin every single time with so much care and attention.  Every time I’m in Miami, visiting ASHA is an absolute must! I a
