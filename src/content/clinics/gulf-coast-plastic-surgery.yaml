      Dr Leveque, her office and medical staff are undeniably top notch. They make you feel heard and valued as soon as you enter their office. They have an amazing bedside manner and all of my questions were answered each and every time.

      Dr. Butler is an amazing surgeon! This is the second time I have had major procedures with him and both times I have been beyond happy with the results. Additionally, the staff is warm, welcoming and extremely supportive with all of your needs during a very sensitive time.

      Wonderful people.  Dr Butler is a gem: skilled, knowledgeable, experienced, and very personable.  As a fellow Heath care provider, those are the qualities that I look for in my providers.  Truly impressed and my wife is extremely pleased with her results.  Now it’s my turn!!
