      I’ve been seeing Sandra for over 5 years, and I truly wouldn’t trust anyone else with my face. She’s incredibly skilled in her art, always takes her time, and never cuts corners. Her work is natural, precise, and consistent every single time. It’s rare to find someone who blends expertise with genuine care the way she does. She’s simply the best — I wouldn’t go anywhere else!

      My experience with semaglutide has been really good so far. I’ve noticed steady weight loss and better control over my appetite without feeling too restricted. It’s also helped me stay more consistent with my healthy habits. I haven’t had any major side effects, and overall I feel more confident and motivated. Definitely a positive experience for me.
