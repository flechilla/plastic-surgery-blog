      I am 2 months post op from a circumferencial tummy tuck, muscle repair, lipo 360, breast reduction and lift, and I am in love with my body. Dr G gave me my dream body and I can not thank him enough. If you are on the fence about your surgery I suggest you book it now. I had a smooth recovery. Thank you Dr G and all his wonderful staff.

      Dr G and all of his staff are incredible! Olivier was fantastic to work with getting my initial quote and everything scheduled for my procedure.

Melissa is so welcoming and helpful answering all my questions and making sure I had all my post-op appointments and massag
