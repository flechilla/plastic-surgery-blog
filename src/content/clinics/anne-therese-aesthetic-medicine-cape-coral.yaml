      I went in today for my first facial filler. The office is beautiful and the staff is amazing. Vanessa was so attentive to what I told her I wanted my lips to look like and she really took her time. I’ve been nervous about how it would feel.  Her touch was gentle and she made me feel super comfortable. I am so impressed. I cannot give enough stars for this experience! I am a client for life!!! Than

      I had an excellent experience with Vanessa. She was knowledgeable, gentle, and took the time to really listen to my goals. The results look natural and I felt completely comfortable throughout the entire process. She has a gentle touch and it did not hurt a bit. Highly recommend! The spa is also very clean and everyone else is very friendly and welcoming!

      I was a first time customer today at your Bonita springs location and Vanessa was the kindest and most professional yet real skin care professional I have ever seen.    I drove a longer distance and wasn’t sure but it was above and beyond experience.   Vanessa made me feel so comfortable at a time that I usually dread and feel much anxiety.    Hope to keep seeing her !
