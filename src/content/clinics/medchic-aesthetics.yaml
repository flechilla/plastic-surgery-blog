      I had an amazing experience at Med Chic Aesthetics. Came in for a facial and left feeling very relaxed and feeling with brand new skin. The esthetician Aly is super sweet and attentive, answered all my questions and very knowledgeable! I will definitely be back!! The receptionist Natalie was also very welcoming, 10/10 would recommend.
