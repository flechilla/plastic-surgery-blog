      I made the perfect decision choosing this clinic. Everyone was truly an angel. I had a breast lift, and they guided me through every step of the process with so much care and professionalism. They even scheduled an extra follow-up appointment after my procedure, which many places don’t do. Thank you all for everything. I’ll definitely be recommending you to everyone!

      I had a wonderful experience at Premier Aesthetic Surgery. I flew in from California and completed all of my pre-op preparations out of state, and Thalia was incredibly helpful every step of the way—even after I returned home. The facility is beautiful, modern, and exceptionally clean, which made me feel comfortable and well cared for throughout the entire process. I highly recommend them.

      After I booked and paid in full, communication drastically declined. They changed surgeons on me without notice and changed my actual surgery date twice, which caused me to lose a significant amount of money on airfare, Airbnb, and travel arrangements. Most alarming, they completely changed my surgery. I went in for breast implants and came out with a breast reduction. I was required to sign docum

      Premier, I sincerely appreciate the wonderful girls at the front desk. Analía is a truly kind and caring young woman who genuinely looks after the patients. Additionally, Arlene took the time to massage me and attentively addressed every detail, which meant a lot to me.
