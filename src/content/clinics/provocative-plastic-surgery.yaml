      I had a bad experience with this clinic. I went to do my pre-operative exam. I had all the exams. The clinic nurse asked me for another blood test and an x-ray. As I was running out of time, I went to where the CLINIC indicated to do the exams. I paid 200 dollars on my card. I paid at the clinic. I have the receipt.

      I regret ever trusting this clinic with my surgery. My experience was an absolute nightmare from start to finish.

      Everyone at provocative it’s amazing.  Juliet is the best. Anything you need she is there for you 100 percent. If you are hesitant don’t be. It’s worth the pain specially if they treat you as good as they do.

      I’m not sure where to begin when it comes to thanking this incredible Provocative team. My journey started with a consultation with Mariana (La Adoro), and though there was a lot of back and forth, Yesenia’s patience and care when she took over for Mariana were truly exceptional. When I arrived at the clinic, I was warmly greeted by my coordinator, Juliet, who was so sweet and answered all my ques
