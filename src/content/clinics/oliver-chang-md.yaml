      I came in for Lipo 360 and BBL with Dr. Chang. I’m still recovering but the experience has been amazing. The nurses and other staff (especially Gabriella) have been so amazing! 10/10 recommend. Dr. Chang does amazing work and even though I’m still recovering, I can see the difference.

      Don’t do it!! Waste of your money! I had my surgery done 2 years ago with Dr. Chang wasn’t happy then definitely not happy now. He left my stomach lumpy and my butt doesn’t even look like I had anything done. Called an asked to speak with the Dr. wanted before and after pictures got nothing!
