      As always,  a thorough and unrushed full body exam.  An absolute must for this fair skinned and freckled senior tennis player in Florida. Juliana is gentle and thorough and answers questions clearly.   Zamarys, her assistant was friendly and helped with a sunscreen purchase,  saving me time.  An excellent office and highly recommended.   Thank you Dermatology Solutions!  Side note,  the product in

      I had my visit today and wanted to share how amazing Christina treated me. I  felt comfortable from the beginning.  She answered my questions and totally put me at ease. Jenna was also very informative and pleasant. This was a great visit. Merry Christmas to all at Dermatology Solutions.

      I had the pleasure of being seen by Ms. Juliana and Zamarys for my first visit there. I was extremely nervous and stressed due to a heavy week of a health scare. They were very comforting and listened to me were patient with me and explained everything thoroughly. I was recommended to go there by the ER and I can see why. I recommend this location! Even upon entering I was immediately greeted with

      The staff at Dermatology Solutions have come to know my face and place my name to it. They are consistently friendly, kind and efficient. Being in healthcare myself and experiencing multiple skin cancers, I appreciate Dr Mancl’s throroughness and willingness to accommodate my urgent needs/concerns. I’d like to recognize Alicia for her professionalism. She is consistently friendly and approachable

      I saw Jenna Hartt for a bad case of hives. She’s a great PA - listens to what you have to say and does not rush you through the appointment. Her assistant Christina is very kind and gentle. They both were very caring and considerate and efficient. I am vey happy that I was able to get in quickly and have the hives resolved. I would recommend this team  at dermatology solutions!
