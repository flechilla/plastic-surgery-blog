      This office is efficient, if you’re on time you're usually in seeing your doctor within 5-10 min of your apt. The nurses are always pleasant. I had to get something removed from my nose so I preferred a plastic surgeon. I saw Dr. Greenberg and am appreciating the results, it’s already healing very well.

      Both Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Burt Greenberg are straight forward, kind and professional.

I highly recommend the clinic’s services regarding dermatology.

Important to mention because the necessity of balancing a doctors time to keep costs low, respect for patients time because we have work and home obligations too and the necessity of giving each patient the time and attention their unknown issue might require all confl

      Dr. Hennessy is an amazing doctor. She's incredibly gentle and I felt very comfortable allowing her to help me with a very personal issue. She was knowledgeable about anything I had questions for and she had prompt, full solutions. I never felt uncomfortable or embarrassed. Thank you so much!!
