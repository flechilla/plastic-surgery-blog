      Came for a hydrafacial and was disappointed with prep and quality of service. She did not prep the skin correctly, began extractions while I still had makeup on and immediately dermaplaned my face dry afterwards. After, she scrubbed with cheap CVS drugstore physical exfoliant, too harsh after already extracting. She would rub her forearms on my face multiple times between different steps to show "

      First visit for microneedling. It can tell you once you step into the spa you are cordially greeted, you truly feel confident and welcomed. Jessy was great during the whole procedure you feel like you have known her for ever. Explains step by step, trusted to have her hands on your face. I will definitely go back and will highly recommend her and the staff to family and friends. Thank you!!!
