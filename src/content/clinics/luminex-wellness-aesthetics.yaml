      I just had vivace and foxy eyes opus treatment for the 2d time. Love the clinic and experience w front desk and staff. And love how my face lifted after only 1 treatment. Can’t wait to see results after this second treatment. Highly recommend for the best lasers around Doral.

      So grateful for Luminex . Lorena spotted skin cancer on my nose and other areas that I had no idea about. They took care of everything right away and were extremely professional throughout the whole process. I’m now cancer-free and beyond thankful. Truly the best place.

I had called three times and no return. I did hormone treatment with Dr. Waldo Acebo and told him that my hor flashes had come back and he did nothing, now I'm calling to see if there's something I can do for the hot flashes an

      Very disappointed with my visit / no-visit today, I called three times to try to schedule a facial before I got a call back, I arrived early, and clearly said I only had 45 minutes — I was assured that was fine. 30 minutes past my appointment time, I cancelled my visit, my daughter’s upcoming appointment, and asked to cancel my over 4-year membership. New management clearly does not value long-tim
