      I had a great visit with Mary Michael, DO And her assistant Delia .  I could give 100 of the 100 very professional,  very polite, very respectful and very thoughtful.  I've been there for myself and first time. I am planning to make an appointment for my daughter. They listen  to the patient and they explain everything in details , we feelt  very comfortable and confident with Dr.Mary Michael,DO.
