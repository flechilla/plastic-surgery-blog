      I cannot recommend Nathalia enough. She has been absolutely amazing throughout my post-op recovery. From the moment I walked into her room, I felt comfortable, cared for, and in the best hands. She always explained every step of my post-op process in detail, which made me feel secure and confident that everything was going to be okay.

      Nathalia was amazing during my recovery after silicone implant surgery. Her lymphatic massage really helped reduce swelling and speed up the healing process. She’s very careful, explains everything clearly, and makes you feel comfortable throughout the session. I highly recommend her for anyone looking for professional and trustworthy support during this time! Thank you 🙏🏻❤️

      I can’t rave enough about this lady !! I went to her sad and depressed because I was diagnosed w capsular contracture at 6 weeks post op. I started w Natalia at 7 weeks and by the time I went to my surgeon for my 3 month post op he said I don’t know what you’re doing but keep doing it ! You are winning the battle !!! She is professional and amazing at what she does !!
