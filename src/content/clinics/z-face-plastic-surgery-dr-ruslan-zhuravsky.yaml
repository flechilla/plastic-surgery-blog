      I am an out of town ethnic patient from Canada and I am so satisfied with my results with Dr.Z and his team. From consultation to surgery day, Dr.Z and his team were warm, responsive and addressed all my concerns. Having Dr.Z walk through the process of a rhinoplasty, and explain how he would achieve my desired end result (as every case is different) was very reassuring. I did the awake rhinoplast

      I had a lip lift done by Dr. Z, and he also performed rhinoplasties on two of my daughters. We truly couldn’t be happier with the entire experience and the results. Dr. Z took extra care with us every step of the way and always made each of us feel completely comfortable.  His staff is incredible, warm, attentive, and genuinely caring. You can tell they all truly care about their patients. We are

      My initial consultation with Dr. Zhuravsky was spectacular.  Upon arrival, Valerie and Barbara were very welcoming, warm and inviting.  I was immediately attended by the doctor.  Dr. Zhuravsky listened attentively to my desired procedure and provided an honest unbiased opinion which was extremely refreshing! He was more concerned about what was in my best interest than soliciting another patient.
