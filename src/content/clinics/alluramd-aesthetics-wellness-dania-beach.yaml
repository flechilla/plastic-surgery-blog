      I’m here on vacation and decided to treat myself to a Hydro facial followed by LED therapy lighting with might I say an amazing foot massage . Elaina was AMAZING she went above and beyond I have to say the best facial Ive ever had. Bonus *she was a sweetheart full of helpful skincare knowledge. Followed by some Tox for brow lift, forehead and crows feet as I was due so said hey why not! I’m glad I

      I have gotten a few HydraFacials and Skin Pen done at AlluraMD by Elena and have had a great experience. Elena does a great job, really takes her time and takes into account your specific skincare needs.

      ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Review for Allura MedSpa, Dania Beach– Microneedling with Brooke Buchanan , PA-C  I had such a great experience at Allura Spa for my microneedling treatment! The space is absolutely pristine, cozy, and very comfortable — it immediately puts you at ease. The staff spent all the time needed to answer my questions, not just about the procedure I was having, but also about other treatments

      I LOVE MY HYDRAFACIAL EXPERIENCE WITH ELENA! Elena was amazing, above and beyond. My skin feels amazing and it was so relaxing.  Also, for my Botox, BROOKE is the bomb!! Knows what she’s doing and is great.  I’m an allura member and it’s so nice having my cash accumulate and spoiling myself here! Highly recommend :)

      I had my first CoolSculpting treatment at AllureMed Spa and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. The atmosphere was calming, and the staff made me feel completely relaxed and reassured throughout my session. Everything was explained clearly, which really put me at ease as a first-timer. I felt comfortable, cared for, and confident in the treatment I was receiving. Highly recommend A
