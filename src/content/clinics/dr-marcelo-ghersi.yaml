      Dr. Marcelo Gershi is truly exceptional. From the very first consultation, he made me feel confident, safe, and fully understood. His professionalism, attention to detail, and genuine care are unmatched. The surgery experience was smooth, the follow-up was excellent, and the results are even better than I imagined. My nose looks natural, harmonious, and perfectly suited to my face. I am beyond gra

      If I could leave zero stars, I would. This was the worst medical experience of my life and my biggest regret is choosing Dr. Ghersi.  In 2022, I went to Dr. Ghersi for a septoplasty to fix a deviated septum and a rhinoplasty for cosmetic concerns. During our initial phone call, I specifically asked if he had experience with deviated septums. He responded in a condescending and arrogant tone, claim

I’ve repeatedly tried to schedule an in-person appointm

      I had a complex rhinoplasty revision and a breast augmentation with Dr Ghersi almost two weeks ago and my experience was amazing. His staff, and most importantly himself, his bedside manner, and the way he treated me especially right before surgery when I decided to change the implant size. Although they didn’t have the size readily available, he made sure he could get it in time for surgery. I ac

      I’ve trusted Dr. Ghersi  with multiple procedures over the years, and the results have been consistently incredible. I had an abdominoplasty in 2021 and recently returned for a breast augmentation, submental lipo, and SkinTite in 2025, every experience has been flawless. His skill, attention to detail, and calming bedside manner made me feel completely confident from start to finish. The results l
