      Had an amazing experience. Went in there not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised how comfortable they made me feel and attended to my needs. Went there originally for some “Brotox” and walked out also with their weight loss program. Sheyla is very knowledgeable and experienced, really loved how she integrates the art of feeling and looking good. I would highly recommend.
