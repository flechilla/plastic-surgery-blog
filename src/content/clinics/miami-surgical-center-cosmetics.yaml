      Save yourself. I asked for a thigh lift. Woke up from surgery and only had thigh lipo. They gas lighted me for a year and said basically to wear the farmer and that it takes time to heal. It’s hard to get anyone even on the phone. Not to mention my legs are just deformed worse and they focused on one part of the thigh so only that’s now indented and made my legs look worse. Money was never the iss

      It has been two months since my tummy tuck at the Miami Surgical Center.  My experience was remarkable, incredibly happy with the service and care of everyone, from the doctor to the professional staff. Lily is excellent, responded all my questions, genuinely nice and was always available. When first walked in for the consult, everyone made me feel at ease and comfortable. After the surgery I rece

      Great experience and my results are PHENOMENAL! I am extremely satisfied. They have really great doctors. You just have to really stay on the front office because they are so busy. Call if you have any questions. Best time to call is early in the mornings before noon. They will get back with you if noone is available to answer your call. Be sure to get cleared by your primary doctor before paying
