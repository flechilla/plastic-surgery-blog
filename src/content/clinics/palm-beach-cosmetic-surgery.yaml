      After going on several consultations for a breast implant removal procedure with a breast lift, I was sure Dr. Sistare was going to be the doctor I would choose. He listened carefully to what I wanted and explained step by step how and what to expect from the procedure. He took his time to answer ALL of my questions. I didn’t feel persuaded to change my mind about what I wanted. He listened! I hav

      WARNING about Michael Sistare. This is my abdomen almost two months after liposuction. I have plenty of fat left over post procedure as well as unevenness. There is zero definition at all which is something I specifically went over in the consultation. I had more definition before the procedure than after. Also I have plenty of fat left on my arms and only a very small portion of fat was removed.
