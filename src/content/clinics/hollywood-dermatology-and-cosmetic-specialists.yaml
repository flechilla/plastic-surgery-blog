      Saw Dr. Vassiliki Papastavros twice already. She is very knowledgeable and helpful. Had two biopsies and happy with results. Wait time was good and staff were friendly. Only wish there was an online portal but the staff are good with calling about results right away. My husband saw the PA and was happy with his care too

      I was so lucky to find Dr. Papastavros and be able to schedule an appointment with her in such short time (just 1 day). Dr.Papastavros is an amazing doctor, she has excellent bedside manners. The office stuff provided all necessary paperwork, was very polite and helped in all possible ways. Highly recommend Dr. Papastavros!
