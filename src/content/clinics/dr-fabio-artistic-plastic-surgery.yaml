      Dr. Fabio Castro saved me from an open wound in my leg from an accident. He was very professional, kind, and very attentive to my needs throughout the surgery and the post recovery. His team in the office is also very professional, kind and very efficient with the paperwork I needed for my job and such.  I highly recommend them 👍🏽
