      LOVE LOVE LOVE DR DOWBAK!!!  I had 2 bbl with her is amazing and has good attention to detail. You don’t even have to know what you want out of surgery just sit back and relax and let her do her thing. I’m happy I was able to have her as my surgeon with her decades of surgical experience and reconstruction surgery experience. I have been turning head since I left her office after bbl 1 and bbl 2.

      Dr. Dowbak did my 360 surgery in 2020. I'm still snatched. I'm truly sad about the news of Dr Dowbaks Passing. What a great Surgeon.  Will be missed. Prayers to Dr. Dowbak Family and Friends.

      First, I want to say that Dr. Dowbak is a very sweet person.  Almost a year ago, Dr. Dowbak offered to do Top Surgery for me pro bono due to my insurance not wanting to assist me in the removal, even with my tumor. (Yes, benign, however it causes me pain and a lot of discomfort, especially when in a binder.)  One of my best friends took the time to drive 2 hours to where I lived to take me to Miam

Unprofessional and just sitting and doing nothing but fraud activities to your finance adding more and more unnecessary fees. They really do gotta get rid of the staff there dowback needs to see why she’s loosing customers. Went in for preop asked that I pay the whole amount first b
