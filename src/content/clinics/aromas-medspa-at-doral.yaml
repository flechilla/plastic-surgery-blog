      I had an excellent experience at Aromas Med Spa in Doral. The staff is incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and makes you feel comfortable from the moment you arrive. The service is outstanding, and I couldn’t be happier with the laser hair removal treatments, the results have been amazing. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for quality care and great results.

      Love Aromas & especially Nayla! I wouldn’t trust anyone else in Miami for my Botox. The team are so friendly and professional and put me at ease for my first even Botox. I was nervous to begin my aesthetic journey and they listened to the look I was going for, I’m so happy with my results!
