      Terrible experience. I got a lip lift with Mirmanesh on March 24th, 2025. I asked him and the operations manager FOUR different times how long would it be until I can go back to having full range of motion because I am a wedding singer and had months of shows booked in advance.

      Hands down Dr.Michael is the best at what he does. I was referred by a friend she gets her lips/facial fillers and she always looks amazing. My first visit was Amazing! He made me feel comfortable & even educated me on the new stuff. My treatment was good and the results was great. I went in for fillers & Botox and cheeks. Im love with the results. Can’t wait to get my round 2. Thank you Doctor.M
