      My experience has been really great! I had Dr. Kreegel for a tummy tuck. My results is going really well and I’m only 4 days post-op. Day by day I feel better and better! I’m happy so far so I can imagine the results after a full recovery. I recommend anyone that’s looking for this procedure to choose him and you will be happy with your overall process.

      Hi guys! I had a lipo 360 and abs etching with Dr. Kreegel a year ago. At firsts I was scared but I decided this was the moment to take care of myself and without a doubt, this was the right choice to make, he snatched my abdomen and that allowed me to feel more confident in my body. He’s a great surgeon for sure. Thank you for helping me with this life changing procedure.
