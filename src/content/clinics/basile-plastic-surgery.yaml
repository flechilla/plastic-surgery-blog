      I received injections from Dr. Basile and I absolutely love my results! I’ve been to other doctors’ offices before, but Dr. Basile is by far the best practitioner I’ve seen. He and his team are professional, welcoming, and the environment is serene. Dr. Basile has incredible technique and always makes sure I’m completely comfortable throughout the process. I’ve never had a more pleasant or confide

      I’m so glad a friend referred me to Dr. Basile. I had a breast augmentation with lift three months ago, & my scars are barely visible. The results are outstanding. I also started getting Dysport at his office & I’m so happy with it.  Dr. Basile & his team are professional, compassionate, & attentive. He ensured I was comfortable & informed throughout the entire process, & the staff made every visi

      I recently got implants and couldn’t be happier with the results! Dr. Basile is knowledgeable, proactive, and truly cares about his patients. The real stars of the show are also his front office staff—those ladies go above and beyond every single time. I was so impressed with how quick and efficient they are, and I love that they’re just a text away. Highly recommend!

      Incredible experience with Dr. Basile and his staff. Scheduling my consultation was flexible and quick, and then the pre op/surgery scheduling was perfect for my schedule. Marisa and Kendra up front are so sweet and helpful. Dr. Basile took so much time to walk me through expectations, the process and the recovery. All post op appointments are super quick and easy and I am so so happy with my resu
