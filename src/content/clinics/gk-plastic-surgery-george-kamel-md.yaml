      Dr. Kamel and his team are amazing! They’re very kind and very thorough on ensuring you’re comfortable and well informed about every step of your procedure. I received a breast reduction mid-November and my recovery has been great! You can tell he and his team truthfully care about the work they’re doing and their patients.  I was really nervous about my procedure and scars, but from the work Dr.
