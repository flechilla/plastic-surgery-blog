      I am beyond grateful for Dr. Wiegering and my entire experience. From the very first visit, he was kind, patient, and genuinely caring.

      ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Grateful for Expert Care and Compassionate Support  In June 2025, I underwent a complex surgical procedure with Dr. Carlos Weigering. While the surgery itself went smoothly, my body responded unpredictably in the hours following, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure and an unexpected hospital admission. Though this reaction wasn’t related to the procedure, Dr. Weigering was by my
