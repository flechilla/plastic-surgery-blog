      Hello, I had a FUE hair enhancement done on August 8, 2025. The service was fantastic and super duper nice people! Amanda and Dr. Mike had me in an out in 6 hours, no playing around just getting it done! Im 5.5 months out and it looks gosh darn amazing!!! The results are right on par with where I thought I would be at this time.  Excited to see the finished version still about 5 -7 months out base

      What a beautiful little gem of a med spa in Boca near Mizner! Go see Laila for your injectables (her lip filler technique is perfection) and Dr. Sam for his expertise in all things health and wellness (not to mention his warmth and infectious laugh!). Amanda runs everything beautifully and they just know what they’re doing and are so nice! Listen, we all know that the market is incredibly over-sat

      Amanda exceeded my expectations at my last visit to the Jiva Med Spa in Boca. She was very patient and spent time with me going over my weight loss journey. Staff is very friendly and outgoing with genuine support. Thank you Amanda for making my journey successful and pleasant.

      Jiva Med Spa is amazing. The place is spotless and has a calming vibe the second you walk in. The staff is friendly, honest, and really knows their stuff. They take the time to explain everything so you feel comfortable, and the results speak for themselves. Every visit feels easy and professional. If you’re looking for a med spa that actually delivers, this is the one. Highly recommend.

      Jiva is basically my home away from home at this point haha. I have had the best experience with Amanda and staff with my Trizepetide journey since August. I have lost almost 30 pounds and Amanda even does my weekly injections as im too scared to. She is constantly checking in on me and rooting me on during the journey, its been a really great experience  Because i love Jiva so much i have also sw
