      If you are looking for a place to do laser I really recommend Hollywood Laser. Not only is their machine the best but Gilda has so much knowledge and experience she truly cares about every single client and customizes the sessions to each person. I love that every time I get it done by one person, I would hate to go somewhere that I get a different technician every time. 100% recommend Hollywood L

      My experience at Hollywood Laser Med Spa was exquisite. I had my back, neck, and shoulders done.  Boy am I glad I did! I went from looking like a hairy pig to looking like Zac Efron from the 2000s! Gilda and Giuliana are very friendly and knowledgeable. They know what they’re doing and have an answer to all your questions. I would recommend Hollywood Laser Med Spa if you are looking for laser hair

      I had the best experience at Hollywood Laser. I get laser treatments for my underarms and full face, and the results have been amazing. The staff is professional, knowledgeable, and made me feel completely comfortable throughout the process. The facility was clean and relaxing, and they explained everything clearly before starting. I’m so happy with the results and highly recommend this Hollywood
