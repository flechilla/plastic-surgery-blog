      I had injectable fillers done with her, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The office is immaculate—everything appears meticulously sanitized, creating an environment that is both welcoming and serene. From the moment I walked in, I felt comfortable and at ease. The entire staff is polished, professional, and radiant, which immediately inspired confidence and trust in their expertise.

      Alexandra and Carina are the best!! I did a hydra facial with Carina and micro needling with Alexandra & my skin has significantly improved over the last few months! This is the best my skin has ever looked!! So good I barely even wear makeup anymore since the treatments! They’re so good at what they do and so knowledgeable

      Yesterday was my first time at this med spa. Emily the Nurse  Practitioner did my IV therapy, she was amazing. She was very gentle and very informative.  The spa is very clean. Very cute place. They make you feel at home. I will definitely be going back.
