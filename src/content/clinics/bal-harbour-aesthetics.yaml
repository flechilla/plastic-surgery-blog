      Dr. Fontaine is a true artist. My facelift results look so natural
      that friends just say I look refreshed and well-rested. The entire
      experience felt like visiting a luxury spa, not a surgical center.

      I was nervous about eyelid surgery but Dr. Fontaine put me at ease
      immediately. The results are remarkable — I look 10 years younger.
      Impeccable care from start to finish.

      I've been seeing Dr. Fontaine for fillers for three years now and
      she never disappoints. She has an incredible eye for balance and
      proportion. The clinic itself is gorgeous.
