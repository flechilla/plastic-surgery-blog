      I love the new Lavi Medspa! And their aesthetic Nurse Practitioner Marissa is very professional and detailed. I bought their micro needling package for the face and abdomen. I’ve done 2 out of 3 sessions and am absolutely loving my results. She takes time to make sure the numbing cream is at its full potency so that the procedure is comfortable.

Marissa works alongside a second inj

      I would highly recomend Lavi MD! Gina and Marissa are amazing. Gina did such an amazing job on my laser facials, I cannot wait to get another package. She is knowledgeable, kind, and adept at providing treatments. My hyperpgimentation and texture were visibly improved.

      I had a great experience at Lavi MD with PA Gina for my recent Botox treatment. This wasn’t my first time getting Botox, but I can honestly say Gina stood out. She was professional, attentive, and really took the time to listen to what I wanted. Her technique was gentle, and I barely felt a thing during the treatment.  The clinic itself is clean, welcoming, and well-run, which added to the overall
