      I did 20 Tooth Glam and I am so happy. I had crooked yellow teeth and was ashamed to smile. Glam R Us gave me my confidence back! After my service I could not stop smiling at everyone. The feeling is amazing! If you are considering Tooth Glam do it, I promise it’s the best decision I ever made.. thanks again!!! I attached my before & after for you to compared

      Best experience ever. Fanessa explained everything in detail very sweet and knowledgeable. I had brought my bf with me bc I was nervous but Fanessa made me feel so comfortable and and relaxed.

      I had the tooth glam service and I like them very much. I did 16 teeth. I get compliments at least 3 times a day on my new smile. I left 5 star review because I am completely satisfied.
