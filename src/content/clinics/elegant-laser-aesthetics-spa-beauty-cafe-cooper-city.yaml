      Humera is the best ! I’ve been coming to her and her laser machine is painless and amazing ! She is also super kind , very patient, and respectful!  She also does the best I have ever seen with eyebrow threading & her facials & henna ! I am so happy I have found my new beauty spot !

      I love it! Very professional, puntual at the time to do the service, clean, ambient and music very relaxing. But the best part in my opinion since I’ve been in other laser places is how fast I see result in my treatment. So I 💯 recommend.

      Humera is truly the best! I did my underarms with her and have no hair growth after only 6 sessions!!! Will be starting treatment now on my lower legs, so very happy with her and her services.
