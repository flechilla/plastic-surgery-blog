      I have now had 2 cosmetic surgeries by Dr.Bacoudi and can’t recommend him enough. He’s very caring in his approach and detailed in his work. My personal belief is he is conservative in his approach, but that’s exactly what you want when talking about your health and well being. The entire office staff has been nothing but courteous and kind every encounter I’ve experienced. Thank you all for an am

      Unfortunately, I can’t recommend Dr. Baroudi for Brachioplasty surgery. He may excel in other areas, but my procedure was a fail and will need to be corrected. My arms look bigger now then previously, and one arm is misshapen. My arms still cannot fit in my clothing; my true size since my weight loss. It’s been very disappointing, and expensive to have the results I’m left with.  I’ve been seen by

      Dr Baroudi is a fantastic surgeon, he has removed three carcinomas from me the past few years.  Some were difficult, but you can barely tell any surgery was performed. His staff is very attentive and efficient.  I have never had to sit in the waiting room more than a few minutes to get to see him. I highly recommend him.
