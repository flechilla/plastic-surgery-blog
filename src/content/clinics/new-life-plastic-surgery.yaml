      I had Lipo 360 and a BBL with Dr. Dress on 11/26/2025. My consultant, Valentina, was amazing, very kind, helpful, and patient. She explained everything clearly and answered all of my questions during the scheduling process. My patient coordinator, Anniel, was also wonderful. He was thorough, professional, and very supportive.  As for Dr. Dress, he is truly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met.

      Making an update review on my experience with this facility and doctor. I previously made a review on my experience but now that things are settle, I want to tell the real. My doctor was Dr. Dress. I originally stated in my first review that I was unsure about my butt after surgery, that thankfully has leveled out some but it’s not exactly what I asked for from the doctor. I try to keep in mind th

      I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Jc Alvarez and the entire team. From the very first consultation, I felt completely comfortable, informed, and cared for. Dr. Jc is incredibly plastic surgeon and gave me the results I was looking for. Thank you to all the team.
