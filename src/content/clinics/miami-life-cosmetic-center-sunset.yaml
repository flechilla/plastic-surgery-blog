      Each clinic and doctors have positives and negatives. I chose this clinic specifically because of Dr Daniel Kaufman. Dr Kaufman is the best, he listens to you, explains everything you have to know regarding your procedure even post op he will show you the details even photos under the table which is amazing in my opinion. Comparable to the Dr I had in the past that I only met during the markings a

His care, professionalism, and attention to detail made me feel confident and support

This is definitely the place to go for your cosmetic surgery!!

      I had surgery with Dr. Daniel Kaufman about a month ago and I’m honestly still in shock at how good my results are. He is an amazing surgeon and did an incredible job. I only spent 600 dollars on massages at Miami life. And my body looks absolutely perfect. I had a BBL done, and I truly believe he’s the best doctor you could ever choose. I highly recommend choosing only him. Dr. Kaufman is the kin
