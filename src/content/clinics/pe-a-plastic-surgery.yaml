      Dr. Pena and his staff are wonderful.  I had contemplated surgery for many years and would not trust anyone but Dr. Pena.  He takes the time to listen to your concerns and questions,  and thoroughly explains the procedure and products.  I'm very happy with my results.  Thank you Dr. Pena and staff!

      WOW! From my initial consultation to most recent follow up appointment, every interaction with Dr. Pena and his staff has been fantastic. Such a knowledgeable, talented and honest surgeon with a kind and compassionate team. By far the smoothest surgical process I’ve ever experienced. Highly Recommend
