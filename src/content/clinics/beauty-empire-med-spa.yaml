      I’ve been coming to this spa since it opened, and honestly, I haven’t felt the need to look for another place. This spa has everything you need to feel at home: professionalism, great customer service, and good prices (they’re always offering deals and specials). I’ve done IV therapy, facials, PRP, laser hair removal, and Botox, and all of them have been excellent! Don’t hesitate to visit!

      Beautiful spa with calming energy. I got lazer with Paula and she guided me with each thing she was going to do and it was mostly painless with her skilled hand. Paula and all the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly.
