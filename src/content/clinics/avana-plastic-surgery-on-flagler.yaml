      The pre-op staff was very professional and thorough. Everyone was courteous, answered my questions, and explained everything clearly. Dr. Mameniskis listened to my concerns and responded thoughtfully, which gave me confidence moving forward. I recommend confirming appointment times ahead of time, but overall it was a very positive experience.

      Si my doctor was Dr. Mark Schusterman and let me tell you he is amazing. He made me feel so comfortable and safe.

      I had surgery on January 5, 2026. Dr. Mameniskis was excellent! He already had a plan for my lift and augmentation. Once I told him my goals he knew what size and projection for my implants. All the staff was kind and helpful. I did have one hiccup that was resolved quickly. My surgery was rescheduled because of the hiccup but my coordinator Gabriela worked with me to get the January date because

      I love my doctor and I'm happy with my results but the follow through before and after with the team is bad bad. It's so bad that it makes u feel unsure you are doing the  right thing when asking for a refund or a second round because u desire your dream body and that's sad because they are sweet in person .. I have to go through the stress of calling every day 3 times a day and get the run around
