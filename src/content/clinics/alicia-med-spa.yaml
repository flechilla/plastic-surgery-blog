      I’m going to leave a 5 star review but I do have commentary that I shared with personally with the massage therapist. I got my massage done with Dani (Daniela) and her hands are some but applies a variation of firm to soft pressure. It was relaxing, my muscles were loose thanks to the warm bed and blankets plus, my back cracked once I got up (in a good way). It’s a hotel spa so they barely see peo

      I recently discovered a new Alicia med spa in my neighborhood and decided to give it a try. I booked a face and neck facial with specialist Lucia, and I liked how knowledge and attentive she was. The environment was very welcoming and beautifully designed. They  offered water and snacks for clients, which was a lovely touch. What's more, they use Israeli cosmetics from Christina, a brand I'm alrea

      From the time I contacted the spa and spoke with Sivan I knew this was a spot that I wanted to visit. I arrived after being lost and the spa helped me get to them. From the front desk to the spa room Everyone made me feel welcomed. Mia explain what would be done. Sylvia was my facial technician with Danielle who was monitoring the process. Sylvia explained every step of the process. I will return!

      10/10 recommend! I had a deep tissue massage with Leyla and had such a beautiful experience! Very experienced, she instantly knew my trouble areas and took really good care of them. The spa itself is gorgeous and has absolutely very peaceful vibe. Alice was helping me check in and gave me a tour of the spa. She was very kind and welcoming. I already have my next appointment scheduled for a facial

      Absolutely amazing hands! First of all, what a beautiful & serene spa! From the calming scents to the amazing souls who are there. My massage therapist, Danielle, was everything I have been looking for in a massage therapist, especially as a woman dealing with scoliosis. She listened to my concerns and went straight to work on my problem areas. She knew exactly what she was doing and I left feelin
