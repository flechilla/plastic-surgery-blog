      My beautiful friend Kirsten has been a client of Melissa for a long time and is truly convinced of her abilities. We scheduled a visit with Melissa at her med spa. Even though I have used Botox and fillers previously, I felt anxious. Melissa quickly made me feel comfortable and dedicated time to elaborate on each procedure that could enhance the look of my skin. I placed my trust in her, and she l

      I’m so happy I finally found my forever injector! I’ve been unhappy for a while with my strong forehead lines and had Botox previously but didn’t love the results. My eyes looked weird and I didn’t look like me. But then I found Melissa on IG and started following her for like a year watching and seeing her work and I just knew that she was the one to go to. I’m so glad I gave Botox another chance

I’ve received so many compliments, and I’ll definitely

      I cannot recommend Melissa enough! Not only is she amazing with patient treatments, she was the first person I trusted with my lips and they came out so natural and beautiful. She’s also an incredible educator. I’ve been to multiple of her trainings and always leave with a new pearl that elevates my practice. She’s knowledgeable, approachable, and has such an eye for detail. Whether you’re a patie

      BEST FACIAL EVER. I can’t tell you how many facials I’ve had, and not once have I left thinking, “I can’t wait to come back” — until Jaclyn. She was absolutely incredible. Every step was thorough, intentional, and way ahead of what I’ve experienced elsewhere. I left with my skin on another level (and it still looked that good the next day), but beyond that, I left completely zen. The whole experie
