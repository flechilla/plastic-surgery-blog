      Had laser hair removal Aug 24, 2013, excruciating pain during and after procedure . 5 days later this is what I'm dealing with .in addition at night I wake up every hour because the area is itchy so I have to get out of bed and spray the area with Dermoplast to help with  the itch, followed by Neosporin, or a salve I got from Whole Foods, and a homeopathic gel  made of Calendula ,echinacea ,cantha
