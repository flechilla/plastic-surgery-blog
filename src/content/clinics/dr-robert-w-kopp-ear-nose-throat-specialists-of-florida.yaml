      My experience with Dr.Kopp was an amazing one. He was so attentive and answered every single question I had. My surgery truly transformed my life. I sleep so much better, my sense of smell is heightened, and I feel a great difference in air intake when I take a deep breath now. Recovery was so easy too. I would recommend him a million times. Thank you Dr.Kopp!!!

      Everyone from the front desk to discharge was kind, respectful and professional.  As for Dr. Kopp he explained everything to me and finally got me on the right track to feeling better.  He is the bomb!  Such a kind man & very professional.  Definitely would go back and recommend this office.

      Dr.Kopp is amazing. He did my last ear surgery 2 years ago and that's why I returned to Florida from Kentucky to have him do this last surgery. My experience with him was wonderful.

Thank you for making me feel like I mattered and not just a paycheck. ❤️

      Dr. Kopp is a true professional. Very thorough, caring, and never felt rushed. He made sure I understood everything and kept asking if I had any questions. He performed a scope that was completely comfortable, and even though everything looked fine, he referred me to speech therapy just to be safe (they contacted me the very next day!).  The staff was equally amazing. Lucy at the front desk was fr
