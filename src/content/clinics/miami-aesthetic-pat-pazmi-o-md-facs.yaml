      From my very first consultation through my recovery, my experience with Dr. Pazmino and  the entire team has been nothing short of amazing.  Dr. Pazmino is incredibly skilled, professional, and compassionate. They took the time to truly listen to my goals and concerns, explained everything thoroughly, and made sure I felt comfortable and confident every step of the way. I never felt rushed or dism

      I am extremely happy with the work of Dr. Pazmino. He is definitely an artist, who also cares about safety of his patients. His office was in contact with me on a daily basis during the first week of post-surgery, and they continued later on based the need. I highly recommend this doctor.

      My wife was very nervous going into the Ultra BBL surgery. Dr Pazmino and staff made the entire experience gratifying while easing her nerves. He listened to her every concern and answered all of her questions. The day of the surgery her anxiety was super high, but Dr Pazmino’s bedside manners were not only professional but calming at the same time. After surgery contact and care is very attentive
