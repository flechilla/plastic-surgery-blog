      I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of professionalism at Babyface Med Spa - Patricia Mitev. I purchased a dermaplaning service via Groupon and had a confirmed appointment over the phone, yet she refuses to honor it because she "wants to prioritize her premium clients" instead. This is the exact sentence she used.  Bad luck, I work for a very well known skincare group, live close to her locat

      The best experience ever! Patricia is a true professional and knows exactly what my skin needed. I’ve been to other estheticians that weren’t able to target my problem. Went to Patricia and she was able to treat and fix my skin without harsh tratments and long downtime. I’m a very happy customer and will definitely recommend her services.

      Patricia does an amazing job with the laser hair removal full body and hydro facials. I fly from NY every 6 weeks for these procedures so that tells you how much I enjoy Babyface MedSpa. She’s professional and knowledgeable in her field and I feel I can trust 100% what she’s doing. The ambiance is inviting, well maintained and very clean and organized.

      I go to Patricia for EVERYTHING! For the past two years, she has been amazing, and I would literally travel in order to receive her services. The most affordable and fair pricing compared to any other (and I’ve done my research). I’ve gotten multiple areas and sessions of hair removal, hydrofacial, microneedling, and various products. She is so honest and always has the best advice and recommendat
