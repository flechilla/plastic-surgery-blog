      I took a microneedling course here and it was the best thing I could have ever done for my career advancement. It was so informative, professional, organized and you get to do hands on training with a live model.  The teacher Cindy was super sweet and gave me so much more information and advice than was required. They have every machine and supply you can think of at an affordable price, and offer
