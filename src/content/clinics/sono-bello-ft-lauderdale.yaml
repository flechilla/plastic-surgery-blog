      The customer engagement staff, nurses and the doctor who did my procedure were all responsive and attentive. Samantha was my consultant and she was upfront in breaking down the details of the procedures including financing and timeline. When I met with Dr. Schaal, we had to tweak the procedures in order to get the best results. Realistic expectations were set and agreed upon. His bedside manner wa

      Save yourself the headache, tears, and $10k. Worst experience EVER! I paid for Upper and lower lipo and the ABEX. Believe the Yelp and BBB reviews this place with leave you BOTCHED. It started with my stomach being left with a ridiculous amount of fluids that was not drained properly after surgery. I contacted SONO Bello and they did nothing. I was given an appointment for the doctor to drain the

My surgery was yesterday and while I can’t speak to my full results yet, Dr. Schaal is absolutely awesome. He’s got a great bedside manner, is an excellent clinician, and genuinely cares for his patient. He made me feel safe and completely confident in every decision he made. He

      From the moment you walk in you are greeted by wonderful people who take the time to answer all your questions. I had a lypo and a tummy tuck surgery performed by Dr. Schaal, and I must say he did the work of an artist. I’m am very happy with the results. The post procedure is very well explained step by step with videos sent to your email, so you are not wondering what you can or cannot do. I hig
