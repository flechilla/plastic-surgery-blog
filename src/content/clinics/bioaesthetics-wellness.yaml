      Wickander was very knowledge, professional, and made me feel comfortable. I haven’t gotten a facial in many years and honestly I’m so glad I got it done with him, I did a rejuvenation facial and my face is looking snatched!! Can’t wait to do my next one! If you have any kind of skin concern definitely go to him before you buy a bunch of skin care products!

      Wicklander and his team are the best! I needed to get some labs performed at home and the service and experience was exceptional. Wicklander is going to make sure all of your questions are answers before hand and make sure you feel comfortable throughout every step of the process. I can’t recommend his services highly enough.

      I recently visited BioAesthetics for a PRP facial treatment with Wickander, and I'm absolutely thrilled with the results! From the moment I walked in, I felt at peace in their serene and calming environment.  Wickander was outstanding! His expertise and gentle touch made the treatment a breeze. He took the time to explain the process, answered all my questions, and made sure I was comfortable thro
