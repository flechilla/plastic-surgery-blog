      Jodi is amazing! She did my mom’s eyebrows and they are honestly the best I’ve ever seen. We are so happy with the results. Thank you so much, Jodi! Highly recommend her to anyone looking for perfect brows.

      I've had a great experience with Jodi Kay. The service I booked was a brow and lash combo. Her shop and employees had positive vibes. Everyone was super nice, and Jodi Kay was very professional and gave me tips on how to keep up with my brows and lashes since this was my very first time getting this service done. I loved the final results!!  I will definitely be back and will recommend my family &

      BE AWARE🚨🚨initially I wasn’t going to leave a review… Please make sure her tools have been properly disinfected when booking. She didn’t use any gloves or facial mask while working on my lashes and brows. My skin had a huge breakout after leaving her chair. I booked with her Nov 1st 2024.  It was my first time and last time booking with her. Definitely not worth the price. Everyone’s experience
