      I’ll try to make this review short. I’m an avid mountain biker, my bike slipped out from under me one weekend and my mouth collided with the ground.

      Dr. Todd Sawisch is knowledgeable, attentive and painless. He is what one would want in a physician: approachable and thorough. His office staff is the same way, very professional. Everyone gets a triple A plus. I was a wreck because my nerves were frayed. Dr. Sawisch and his assistant,  Samantha took the very best care of me during an infected tooth extraction. The best! Thank you! 🙏❤️

      Referred  by my dentist because she thinks Dr. Sawisch is the best, and I have to agree. A great experience all around. Everyone professional, friendly & upbeat. The work was perfect, no complications, no pain, healed beautifully. I highly recommend his practice.
