      Choosing Dr. Benjamin Livav was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. He performed my tummy tuck, breast lift, and 6-area lipo, and I am absolutely in love with my results. My body looks incredible, and I finally feel confident in my own skin again.  Dr. Livav is extremely knowledgeable, honest, and caring. He truly listens and delivers beautiful, natural results. His work speaks for itself.
