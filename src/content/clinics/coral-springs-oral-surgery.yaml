      From the moment I walked in, the front desk staff made me feel welcomed. I had my wisdom teeth taken out, and both  Kelly and the Dr. Azzouni were wonderful—kind, professional, and very attentive. They explained everything clearly and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire process. I highly recommend this office!

      This place is great. Straight forward process, with minimal pain. I experienced less pain from multiple teeth removed than one at another office. Kelly is also awesome, along with the other office staff making sure you are comfortable throughout the process. 6 stars 🤩

      I visited the practice for the removal of a wisdom tooth. Everything went very well—the doctor and nurses were very careful and professional. My recovery was smooth, and they followed up after the visit to check on me. I really appreciated the care.

      I had a lower wisdom tooth extraction. From start to finish it was a breeze! Dr Azzouni and his entire staff made the experience much easier than expected. The care, skill and knowledge from everyone helped calm my nerves, and get the job done! I took a couple of pain killers that night, thereafter no need for them! I highly recommend getting your procedure done with Dr Azzouni, he really cares. H
