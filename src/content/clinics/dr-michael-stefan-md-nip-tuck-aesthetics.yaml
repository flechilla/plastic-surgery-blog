      I’m pleased with the work of Dr.Michael Stefan! He is a very professional man as well caring. He listen to all my needs for my 2 surgeries. He gave me his honest opinion for the things I wanted done, I don’t regret a thing. If I had to do it again I would! He has more than 27 years of experience on the field and is a double certified surgeon I definitely recommend Dr.Stefan. 🫶
