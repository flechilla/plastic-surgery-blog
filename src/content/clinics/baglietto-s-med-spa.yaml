      I had the best experience at Baglietto’s Med Spa. The clinic is so clean and the staff was super welcoming. I naturally was nervous at first about my hair transplant but after meeting Dr. Alba and connecting with her team, I felt so at ease. She was great at talking me through the entire process from start to finish. Thus far my results look great. I think adding the IV drip a few days after my tr

      This is the second time I've had lip fillers at Baglietto's Med Spa. The results are incredible; Alba has magic hands and the service is excellent. The staff is super friendly and attentive. I don't live in Miami, but they coordinated my appointment and trip to Miami... it was truly worth it because the results are magnificent... Highly recommended.
