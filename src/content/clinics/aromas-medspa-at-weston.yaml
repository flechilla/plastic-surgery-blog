      Dr. Luciana is absolutely exceptional! She is incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and truly takes the time to make sure her patients feel comfortable and informed. Her patience and attention to detail are unmatched, and she always listens carefully to my goals and concerns. Every experience with her has been nothing short of amazing, and I’ve been thrilled with my results each and every time.

      Luciana is wonderful. She is very knowledgeable and took her time answering all my questions. She was extremely through and did a great job with Botox/dysport injections. I am very happy with the results!
