      I can’t say enough about my experience with Milena! I traveled all the way from Philadelphia to Florida to see her, and it was 100% worth it.  I’ve been to many injectors over the years, including some of the most highly regarded professionals in New York City, and no one has ever achieved results like this. My lips are by far the best they’ve ever looked—beautifully shaped, natural, and balanced.

      I was referred to Milena by a friend of mine who had her lips filled. I had it done  by someone else in 2016 and it did not last a month. I was skeptical. I decided to try again cuz my friends lips came out amazing and my lips are very small and thin. Milena is amazing!  I LOVE my new lips.  She is professional, knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable. . She has my highest recommendation!
