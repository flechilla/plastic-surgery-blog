The spa itself is beautiful and smells amazing every time I walk in. Leo is incredibly kind, professional, and always so helpful. Pamela is so sweet and very knowledgeable.

      Highly recommend! Received laser hair removal treatments here. Super nice and pleasant staff, made me feel very comfortable. Leo is awesome at the front! Always have openings available, super quick appointments! The essential glow package is great because you can get any part of your body lasered every month, with no surprise prices. Painless, quick, and easy! Thank you!!

      This has become my absolute go-to for laser treatments. Their packages are amazing and the technology they use has been the least painful I’ve tried which is great! I am 5 sessions in and already see minimal hair regrowth so 100% recommended 🌟
