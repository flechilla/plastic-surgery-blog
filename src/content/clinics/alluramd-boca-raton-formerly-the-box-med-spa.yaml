      Absolutely obsessed with my results! Micah does laser hair removal on my legs and they’ve never been smoother. She’s professional, gentle, and makes the whole process so comfortable. I actually look forward to my appointments. Highly recommend her if you’re thinking about laser hair removal—total game changer.

      My favorite place for all of my Medspa needs! The space itself is calm, clean, and beautiful, perfect for relaxing skin treatments. Micah always takes the time to understand my skin & customize my facials in a calming environment. I always leave feeling refreshed and taken care of!

      This place is amazing!!!! I had a negative experience with another med spa and came to the box to get fixed up. They did such an amazing job on fixing my lips and making them look 10/10. Not to mention the doctors technique is almost painless. I love it. The location is in a great plaza and their establishment is so clean and professional. All there employees are so kind and really put in the work
