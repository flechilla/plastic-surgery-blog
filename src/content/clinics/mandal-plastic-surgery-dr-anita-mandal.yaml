      Dr. Mandal is always so kind and professional. I’ve had several aesthetic procedures from her over the years and am very happy with all of them. As a plastic surgeon, Dr. Mandal’s bedside manner is top notch. She is always approachable and her knowledge level and skill are unmatchable, in my personal experience. What’s especially important to me is that I feel safe in her hands and I trust her com

      Dr. Anita Mandal is the plastic surgeon I chose because she only specializes in the face and neck. I must admit that I also liked the idea of her being a woman in her field. I have found the quality of work to be at the highest level. I’ve also been very pleased with all of my rejuvenation procedures. She and her staff are kind, compassionate and considerate. I recommend her without reservation.

      ⭐☆☆☆☆ Review: Consultation Appointment Booking By: Office of Dr. Mandal  Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to meet the physician, so I cannot comment on clinical care or outcomes.  My concerns are with the office’s scheduling practices, accessibility, and professionalism.  I traveled over five hours round-trip for a paid consultation scheduled as the final appointment before the office
