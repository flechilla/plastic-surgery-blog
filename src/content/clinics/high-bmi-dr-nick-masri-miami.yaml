      Dr. Nick Masri and his staff are absolutely the best! From the minute you step into his office you will feel comfortable and at ease. Dr. Masri is one of the best plastic surgeon's in the country.  He takes the upmost pride in his work. My breast augmentation and eye lift both look completely natural. You will be nothing but pleased with his work. I highly recommend Dr. Masri for any ps needs!
