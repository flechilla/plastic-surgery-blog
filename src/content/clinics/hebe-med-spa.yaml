      I travel from Charlotte, NC to see Sama for all my facial needs. I trust her completely as she is the epitome of excellence at what she does, professional and highly skilled.  I so enjoy her beautiful personality and value my time with her.  I recommend her highly. I leave feeling refreshed;  a better version of myself with more confidence and my students say “Ms. Morgan, you are so pretty!”

      My mom told me about this Spa and it exceeded my expectations! I came in from France and was in need of facial. Sama was very kind and gentle with my face as it was my first time getting a service like this. Would highly recommend to others! 10/10 experience.

      Excellent and awesome service. I’ve been a patient of Sama for over 4yrs. Everyone I recommended to her have loved their results. I highly recommend her, especially her Botox and facials services.

      I was referred to this Spa by a family member in the area. I am from Maryland and I was in need of some work done to my face. Sama got me right with a facial and gave me a new skin routine. She had products that I purchased from her line. Thank you again Sama! I will be returning & would highly recommend
