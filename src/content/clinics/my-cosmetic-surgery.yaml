      I have been a client at my cosmetic since 2018, and I have nothing but great things to say about this establishment. Starting with Dr. Luke Gutwein who has been my surgeon for the last two operations. He is very kind,  patient and knowledgeable and I have a 100% trust in his work. The staff is also very helpful and I appreciated my coordinator Yarianna for guiding me thru this process with so much

      Yurdeti is absolutely amazing! I've been seeing her for radiofrequency and massage treatments at my cosmetic surgery, and I couldn't be happier with the results. She is incredibly knowledgeable and professional, and she always makes me feel comfortable and at ease during every session. The radiofrequency treatments have really helped with tightening my skin, and her lymphatic drainage massages are

      This clinic is the worst. I've been trying to get my deposit back for a long time now and they refuse to do so. Every time I call is a different story. I call them or text them every week. All I get from them is excuses. Do not go to this place, I REPEAT, run away from this place as fast as you can. I paid $1550 4 years ago, and I haven't gotten my money back yet.

      I got the worst experience with the doctor Jeffrey. Please do not go to the doctor or any of them the clinic it’s disgusting. They’re rushing to get your money and sign papers and then they don’t even answer you when you call for a refund the job Doctor did go run and he do not want to fix it and I have to pay another doctor in the same clinic to fix my problem. $4500 more so sad.
