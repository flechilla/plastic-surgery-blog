      I had the best facial at So Vain Aesthetic with Marlene! From the moment I walked in, she made me feel completely comfortable and welcomed. She took the time to explain the entire procedure beforehand and checked in throughout to make sure I was relaxed and at ease. It was truly the most relaxing experience I’ve had in a long time. The spa itself is absolutely beautiful, clean, serene, and such a

      I have been doing my lashes for several months with Clara and her lashes are amazing!!! I go for a refill monthly with excellent results that continue to last long periods of time. She makes it possible to look beautiful every day effortlessly. Highly recommend the hybrid lashes and refills to have a gorgeous glow daily.

      Obsessed with my experience! The space was spotless, beautiful, and felt so elevated and pampered from the moment I walked in. The service was incredibly personal, professional, and detail-oriented. You can truly feel the difference in the quality of the products used. Everything was top tier. I left feeling sooo pampered, confident, and already excited to come back. Highly recommend this gem!

      I’m currently going through postpartum hair loss and decided to get an IV drip at SoVain. From the moment I called, Ally was so attentive and informative — she explained the options clearly, gave honest recommendations, and made me feel comfortable about my choice. The place itself is super clean and the decor was stunning.  Stephanie was amazing during my IV! She checked on me every few minutes t
