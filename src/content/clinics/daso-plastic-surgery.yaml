      I was a little skeptical about going all the way to Miami, but everyone at the clinic was extremely polite. Dr Persaud did an amazing job and explained everything with great detail. I wanted to do more and I know any other doctor probably would have said yes but he explained why he would not and gave me options. I have zero regrets!

      I chose to give 4 stars because my experience at Daso Clinic had many positive aspects. From the moment I arrived, the front desk staff was very kind and attentive. Dr. Lora was great, and Gloria, the massage therapist, was excellent and very caring.  My main issue was with the coordinator and lack of clear communication. It was not explained in advance that the transportation provided only covers

      Dr.Lora did an extended tummy tuck for my sister in law and the results were mind blowing... Not only did he do a great job he ordered extra after care treatments to ensure proper healing!!! This doctor is the best we found after paying 5 or more consultations at other places! Trust me don't waste your time book with DR.LORA thanks again DR.LORA !!!
