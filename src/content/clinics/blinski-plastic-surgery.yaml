      Dr. B is a very honest, caring, and trustworthy surgeon. I just went for my 3 month follow-up breast implant exchange/bbl reshaping, and if he's not happy, he will fix it. Not rude or arrogant at all he actually has a sense of humor. His staff is very sweet and responds to emails/texts very quickly. I recommend Dr. B 10/10
