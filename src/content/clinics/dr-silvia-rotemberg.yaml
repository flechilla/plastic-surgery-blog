      I had such a lovely experience here! It was my first time doing botox, and the PA Carolina Arce provided the best care! She walked me through her process/ideas while addressing my wants/needs. It made the experience all the more comfortable and helped me relax. Results already look amazing. The staff were also very kind and welcoming, I can’t wait to go back!!

I was told the doctor is taking a vacation and when I called them back to reschedule, I was offered another appointment in 3 weeks which I could not take since my daughter was moving to college. Then they told me to come tomorrow. So I don’t understand how 5 min ago I was told the doctor
