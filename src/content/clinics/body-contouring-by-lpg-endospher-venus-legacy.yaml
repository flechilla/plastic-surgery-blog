      I had an awesome experience with Venus Legacy. It didn’t just trim the fat around my waist, but also significantly reduced the cellulite in my thighs and calves. The total cost of the treatments was a little more than what I had budgeted for, but they were totally worth it.

      The body-shaping specialist I saw at this aesthetics center was professional, kind, and super reassuring. She took her time with each treatment, and that made a world of difference. I was thrilled after my last session because my body had been transformed for the better.

      One of my close friends in Miami told me to go to Body Contouring by LPG, Endosphere, Venus Legacy when I said I wanted a flatter stomach without working out or surgery. My stomach didn’t flatten overnight, but it did eventually, so I’m pleased with the quality of care this team delivered.

      Following my second pregnancy, I went to Body Contouring By LPG, Endosphere, Venus Legacy to try to get my pre-pregnancy body back. They helped me reach all my body-shaping goals, and that’s why I can wholeheartedly recommend this Miami aesthetics clinic.
