      I had surgery this past Friday, and I can honestly say my experience with CG Cosmetics surgery center was amazing from start to finish. Every single staff member was kind, professional, and truly made me feel comfortable and well cared for; from my Coordinator Norgis all the way to my anesthesiologist, sweetest pregnant lady ever.  A very special thank you to Dayanis and the entire post-op team —

After payment, that completely changed. I was l

      My experience was exceptional from day one. From the very first point of contact, Camila Calfaro was absolutely outstanding professional, attentive, and genuinely committed to excellence.

      Just want to start by saying the massage therapist EVELYN Posada Esnobol was absolutely amazing wow. She really handled me with care and she was so so sweet. You can tell that she cares about her patients. I highly recommend you request your lymphatic massages with her.  My coordinator was Maria and she was great as well, she answered all my questions and she was very patient with me which I truly
