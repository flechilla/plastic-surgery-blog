      I have to say I don’t speak Spanish, but I saw work that Dr Spera did on one of my friends and it came out amazing so I decided to see Dr sperra for my procedure.

      He is an Amazing Doctor and staff. I had a lower neck and face lift and I’ve had zero complications. I was very scared didn’t know what to expect and the recovery was mild. Really happy with my results. I can see my neck and jaw line again. Thank you Dr Spera.

      Dr Spera  is truly the best!! He answered all my questions in person and also in social media. He understood what I wanted and he delivered!!! Surgery was easy, his whole office staff  were amazing and made me feel safe. I'am one day post op and Im not in any pain, just pressure. If you are thinking about a breast surgery you should do it with him!! You will be in the best hands.
