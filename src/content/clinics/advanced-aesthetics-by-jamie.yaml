      Jamie is such a caring & knowledgeable esthetician!! I have super sensitive skin & rosacea & Jamie always manages to make me leave with a smile & feeling beautiful, no matter how much I came in feeling full of acne & ugly. Jamie does amazing extractions & always makes my face feel clean & clear. She knows exactly what my skin needs, often mixing treatments, like dermaplaning & a chemical peel. Als

      Jamie is absolutely amazing!!! Check her out, you won’t regret it! From consultation to rescheduling, she didn’t miss a beat. Her space was pristine, inviting and full of warm energy.  With the pandemic present, my skin had been neglected for months. My expectations were exceeded.  I am looking forward to my next treatment. Thank you so much Jamie, for bringing my skin back to life!!! ☺️

      Jaime is the best! I call her my face angel :) She has performed peels and super hydrating facials, plus facials that I just needed to de-stress. If you want the best; if you want your skin to improve; if you are tired of going to esthetician's who don't make a difference, you need to go Esti Bestie! She’s my tried and true and highly recommend her!
