      I had an eyelid rejuvenation treatment at Novaskin med spa and couldn’t be happier with the results. The staff was incredibly professional, gentle, and attentive from start to finish. The procedure was quick, comfortable, and made such a natural difference in my appearance. I feel refreshed, brighter, and more confident. Highly recommend!

      I came to Miami on vacation and tried a package of treatments - laser skin resurfacing, hair-growth laser, and laser hair removal. I trusted Inga’s advice, and I’m glad I did. She’s very professional, and her team did everything carefully. The results are great, the place looks nice, and the whole experience was really good. Highly recommend Novaskin Med Spa.

      Absolutely loved my experience at Novaskin med spa. I came in for microneedling RF on the Vivace device to smooth out fine lines. The space is elegant, private, and boutique, super relaxing. Inga was warm and professional, and the treatment was comfortable. Highly recommend!
