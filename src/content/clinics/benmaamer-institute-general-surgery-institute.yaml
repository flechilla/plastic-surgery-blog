      Here’s an updated version with those details included:  ✨ Review: I had an amazing experience at this med spa!

      I'm Minh. I’m a new patient with Dr. Steve. I don't know how much I appreciate everything he did. When I had surgery 2 weeks ago with him in the Cape Coral hospital, I loved the way he took care of me. I feel I'm so lucky to have him do my surgery, and I am feeling better now. Thank you so Dr. Steve ❤️
