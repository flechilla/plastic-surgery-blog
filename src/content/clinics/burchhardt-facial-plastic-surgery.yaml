      Words cannot describe how thrilled I am with the lower face lift, neck and eye lid surgery that Dr. Burchhardt did on me.  From my first consult until my three month post surgery, Dr. Burchhardt was kind, extremely detailed, and thorough and always available with any questions or concerns that I had.  I have recommended her to numerous friends because I know they will be as pleased as I am.  I LOO

      I was referred to Dr. Burchhardt to close a wound left from a MOHs procedure on my upper lip.  Her work was amazing in that she stitched the wound closed so the closure blends into the contours of my lip and there is no evidence of a scar.  It was a minor procedure but she took great care to provide me with the best possible outcome.  I recommend her without reservation.

      I am extremely pleased with Dr. Burchhardt and my face & neck lift. She is so easy to talk to and very professional. My surgery went smoothly without much bruising or pain. The recovery has been a breeze. I would highly recommend her! Photos from left to right are before surgery, the day after surgery, 3 weeks after and 6 weeks after.

      I went to Dr Burchhardt for some facial/neck and eye plastic surgery.  I was so pleased with my outcomes and recovery.  She was so reassuring and made me feel very confident about my procedures. I would not hesitate to recommend her for both her skills as a surgeon and her patient care.
