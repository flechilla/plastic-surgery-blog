      Ivett is a true professional who gets as excited about seeing results as her customers do. I go to her for IPL treatments for sun damaged skin. And I saw results from the very first treatment (unlike other places where I barely saw results even after 3 treatments). She is the real deal and I am so glad I found her. My skin looks entirely different than when I started with her! I am very happy.

      Yvette did an excellent job with my ipl.   She took her time to do it right by being professional and explained how to care for your skin after treatment.  She is knowledgeable of her trade.  I highly recommend her to anyone who needs skincare. Thank you! Keep up the good work!

      Ivett is a gem! I actually found the MeTime Med Spa on a Groupon. I bought one for a friend also and she hasn’t stopped thanking me for this wonderful experience! It is spotless, Ivett is so professional, and the Hydra facial makes you feel like you’re glowing when you leave. I’m addicted and so is my friend👍

Ivett is so amazingly nice, professional-always sends reminder texts about apts or follows up on new clients, thorough on facials, thoughtful about wearing mask, very clean and spotless spa, and the costs are very reasonable/affordable for the services. I've had facials and ipl and each time th

      Having to wear a mask for work was destroying my skin. Ivett helped me come up with a plan to get my skin back in shape and I could not be more grateful for her amazing services! Highly recommend!
