      After having spent six months having multiple eye surgeries to try to save my right eye, the decision was made by my prior surgeon to refer me to Dr. Stephen Laquis. We weren’t going to be able to save the eye, and Dr. Laquis was going to perform an enucleation (eye removal).

      I want to share my experience to help ease the mind of anyone who may be feeling nervous. Dr. Laquis was incredibly patient and gentle. He never seemed rushed and took his time, which made me feel very comfortable.  I did need to return for a small revision to adjust my eyelid and tighten a muscle, but it truly wasn’t painful at all.

      My upper eye lids and under bag surgery, went very well, no pain. All the staff from the  beginning to the end were very nice and professional and explained all the details of my surgery. I would definitely recommend Dr.Laquis MD.

      The explanation of the procedure and the actual procedure was very different. Dr Laquis administered the injection for numbing and immediately following was the procedure for cauterizing my tear ducts. There was no time in between for the initial medication to take effect. It was very painful and he seemed very rushed. My overall experience was not positive. I would not recommend him.
