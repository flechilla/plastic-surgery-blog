      I absolutely loved my visit to Estetika Med Spa! Opal at the front desk was amazing, so knowledgeable, kind, and welcoming. She took the time to assess my concerns and recommended several treatments for my hyperpigmentation.

      This med spa exceeded my expectations. I did body sculpting and a facial, and both experiences were exceptional. The space is beautiful and calming, the staff is attentive and highly skilled, and the treatments were tailored to my needs. I noticed results from the body sculpting and my skin looked instantly refreshed after the facial. A true luxury experience—I highly recommend.

Before giving me Botox injections, she explained everything to me in great detail and answered all my questions, not only about Botox but also about other cosmetic procedures. I had never heard of some of them before, so we've scheduled them for future visits. The Botox results are excellent. I
