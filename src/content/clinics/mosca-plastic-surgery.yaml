      Dr. Mosca’s practice was a great experience from start to finish. Anyone considering cosmetic surgery knows how nerve-racking the process can feel — the nerves, the doubt, the fear of the unknown. From the very first interaction, the entire team made me feel supported and at ease every step of the way.

He answered all of my questions from consultation to pre op to post op.  I truly felt heard when expressing what I was hoping to achieve with the surgery and in the end he absolutely nailed it. I wanted natural looking breasts that fit my body perfectly and I

      I have to say this was the MOST wonderful experience  ever with a consult and I have done many.  First , Dr Mosca is Amazing.  Beyond talented, he has such a warm way . Dr. Mosca listened to me babble on about what I wanted and he set realistic expectations for me in what I could achieve with the body I have not the photos in a magazine. For that I am  so grateful. An added bonus is the Fabulous N
