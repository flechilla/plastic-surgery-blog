      The absolute worst decision I could have made… Was to continue on my previous path of poor health, poor decisions and remaining closed minded. I was Reffered to Dr Choi from another Dr friend through concierge medicine so I am familiar with Great Doctors who practice great medicine and Dr Choi is definitely in that league. I went to see him for hernia repair and after looking at my charts and my b

      Dr. Choi and his team were amazing! I’m 7 months post op. Down 70lbs and feel better than ever. No complications with the surgery. Everything was smooth from the start.

      Hello, I had surgery with Dr. Choi 5 days ago and I have lost 17 pounds already ! The biggest result for me so far is that the swelling in my legs has gone down significantly. Everything from the Doctor , the office staff and the hospital staff are extremely attentive. I can truly say this feels like the best decision I ever made and chose to do for myself.  Trust the process!

      Thank you Dr.Choi for everything you did, for instilling confidence before the surgery and for assuring me everything was gonna be okay. One of the best DR I’ve ever had, very attentive with its patients and I would definitely recommend him to anyone. It was worth the process even tho I was scared and nervous he made sure everything went smoothly and helped me be calmed. Thank you.

      traveled a long way to Florida for the operation and was very stressed. However, when I met Dr. Michael Choi and his entire staff, all of that stress disappeared. Dr. Choi is not only a kind and friendly doctor, but also a highly skilled and competent specialist. On the day of my surgery, I didn’t feel any pain — he did an excellent job. He consistently checks in on me and truly cares about my wel
