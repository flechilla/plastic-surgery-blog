      I’ve had such a great experience at Glow! I got Dysport with Yael and couldn’t be happier with the natural results. I recently had a peel with Kloei and can’t wait to see how my skin keeps improving. The staff is always friendly and welcoming, and the whole place has such a positive vibe. Yael is so knowledgeable and honest with her recommendations, and Kloei was super kind and took her time expla

      I love glow! From the friendly and helpful front desk staff to the amazing Yael, who is so kind, honest and knowledgeable, there is nobody else I would trust with my face!  She  never tries to push any unnecessary treatments or procedures and is a true professional. If I could, I would give 10 stars!
