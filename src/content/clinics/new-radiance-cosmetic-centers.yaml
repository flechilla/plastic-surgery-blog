      I have had nothing but the best care with my surgeon and his staff. Dr. Jonathan Schwitzer has been there for all the calls, texts and appointments. Jamie is my guardian angel and has stayed in touch with me and made sure I've had all the resources needed from beginning to the end. The nurse practitioner Kelsey was by my side throughout my surgery and recovery. Overall experience has been a 10/10.

      Dr. Schwitzer is an outstanding physician with excellent technique and a truly reassuring bedside manner. He is attentive, thorough, and takes the time to make sure his patients feel comfortable and well cared for. His follow-up care is exceptional, and his attention to detail really sets him apart. We would highly recommend Dr. Schwitzer :)

They had a special going on for 30 units of botox so I decided to give them a try. After 2 weeks the botox was not having it's usual effects so I reached out. They invited me back to fix the issue and administered about 10 more units of b

      Great customer care and beautiful facility! The woman that did my Cool sculpting was excellent. She was very reassuring & professional. She’s due to have a baby in December though so I’ll miss her next time.
