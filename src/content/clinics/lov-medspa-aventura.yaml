      Amazing experience! I had a Morpheus8 treatment at this Med Spa and Andrea was amazing. She took the time to explain everything clearly and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire process.

      Since my first call with Lov Med I was happy about their customer support. I’m from out of town and they offered a video consultation with Andrea and Richard the manager was also accommodating and welcoming. I just finished my second treatment with Andrea and she is professional, knowledgeable and listens to my concerns. I highly recommend Lov MedSpa.

      Came to get PRF EZ-gel. I had a fantastic experience. Although the treatment itself is a bit intensive, Mark made me feel extra comfortable, ensuring he walked me through the process. Ryan as well was great! I enjoyed the atmosphere as much as I did the results. Can’t wait to come back again.
