      Dr Mel Ortega is excellent at what he does. I had the pleasure of him working on my body twice, and he did exactly what I was looking for each time. If ever I need another procedure, I would 100% use him again. Thank you Dr Ortega. K Armendariz

      Do not recommend. Zero stars. Went to him to repair an old vertical scar and do liposuction at the same time. He made the vertical scar longer and added a large horizontal scar. A year later both look horrible. I should have never trusted him to make the scar look better now I have two horrible looking scars.

      I had a tummy tuck on 2/25 w/Dr. Ortega at Moon Aesthetics. Dr. Ortega is very realistic and explains to you in detail what are your issues and what he is going to do. The morning of my surgery he went over my labs, my blood work and he took his time which to me was extremely important. I have had lip/bbl in the past and I knew a tummy tuck was going to be a different procedure with a different ty
