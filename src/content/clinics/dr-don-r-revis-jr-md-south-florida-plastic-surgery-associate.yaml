      Dr. Revis is truly exceptional. His work is absolutely incredible, and I genuinely believe he is a legend in what he does. From the very first consultation to the final result, he was extremely professional, attentive, and reassuring. His staff deserves just as much praise — unbelievably kind, always available, and supportive every step of the way. The entire office has a warm, welcoming environme

      Dr. Revis made me look and feel 20 years younger! I waited 6 months to post this review.  I do not rush into things. I did a ton of research before deciding to have surgery with Dr. Revis. I wanted to make sure that I had the best surgeon and the best outcome possible.  Having said that, choosing Dr. Revis is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.  He is not only a skilled surgeon, he is also a

His staff was wonderful and worked closely with us through the entire experience. Dr. Revis i

      Out of state patient here with breast augmentation done by Dr. Don Revis. My first breast augmentation was done by another surgeon and did not even come close to the experience I had with Dr. Revis. Dr. Don Revis is the Boob God and his staff are absolute Angels 😇.  Everyone that I made contact with at Dr. Revis' office were professional, expeditious in response and never made me feel rushed. Fro

      Dr Revis is the most sweet , wonderful , talented , perfectionist of a man and doctor. I’m beyond grateful to have had him as my surgeon and I’d do this 10x over again with him. His entire staff , the hospital staff as well are all equally as sweet and talented. I was calm before my surgery because I knew I had the best of the best doctor. I trust him and respect him so heavily. He’s a literal ang
