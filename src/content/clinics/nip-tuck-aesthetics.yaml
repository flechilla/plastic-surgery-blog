      My experience with Dr. Stefan and his team exceeded my expectations. I had my initial consultation and I will be honest I was kind of on the fence about getting it done but I realize it was actually me who wasn’t listening I think because I was nervous and I was all over the place with my thoughts. Anyway here I am currently 7 weeks post op and I feel as though I chose the right surgeon. Dr. Stefa

      These have to be the best people I have ever worked with. I know that some people who prefer to be more discreet about getting a procedure or any type of work done, such as myself, might run into some issues if your job requests proof. Not a problem for these girls at all. I was livid when I found out my job wanted more info than your standard "doctor's note: you're cleared to return in two weeks"

      Worst Experience Ever – Do Not Trust This Clinic  I had the worst experience of my life at Niptuck Clinic. My tummy tuck is absolutely terrible — my belly button looks horrible and sticks out as if the muscles were never tightened. The scar is shaped like a smile and looks awful.  My breast surgery is also a disaster. My nipple was left deformed and positioned almost up to my neck. I truly regret
