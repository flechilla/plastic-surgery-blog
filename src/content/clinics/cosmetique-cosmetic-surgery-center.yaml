      Avoid Dr. Robert Hunsaker and overall staff! My experience here was incredibly disappointing and far below any reasonable standard of care.  The results were far from what was promised, leaving me with years of complications and excruciating pain. When I tried to address these concerns, the surgeon and his team were quick to dismiss me and ignore ALL my attempts of communicating and refused to tak

      I visited several surgeons before deciding on Dr Hunsaker. What I loved about Dr Hunsaker is that he took time with me. He listened to all my concerns and took time to answer all my questions. I have had implant surgery a few times before and I kept having issues. After having surgery with him I am completely THRILLED at the results. He delivered exactly what he said he would accomplish. He is AMA

      No under chin waddle!! Dr. Hunsaker did a great job. I am a guy that is trying to keep his professional life going into his mid-life and senior years. This makes a big difference. You look better. You look younger and you feel better. An under chin lipectomy is simple, economical and effective.

      Dr. Hunsaker was the first Dr. I went for consultation and he really knows how to leave an impression. I really felt he generated a lot of peace and great vibes, and he never deviated any questions I asked, he is a very down to Earth man. After him I visited 4 more Doctors for consultation and to explore my options and I ended up going back to him. I do not regret choosing him, he did an excellent
