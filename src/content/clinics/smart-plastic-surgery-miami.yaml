      Dr. Jeff was my surgeon for a tummy tuck and lipo, and I had a very positive experience. He took the time to listen to my concerns, explained everything thoroughly, and reassured me about my expected results. I am currently three weeks post-op, and my follow-up care has been excellent. Lilly and the nursing staff have consistently checked in, addressed my questions, and helped ease any concerns al

      Smart has an amazing group of people That care about the best potential results.  They have operated my girlfriend and other close friends with amazing results.  These types of surgery are only best with a combination of other factors like self care and potentially other surgeries. I am very happy with the result of my girlfriend and the physical and mental changes she has after the surgery.

      Post-Op: 5 Weeks — Breast Augmentation, Lipo, and Abdominal Etching. My entire experience with Smart Plastic Surgery was outstanding! The process was fast, smooth, and highly professional from start to finish. The team made me feel comfortable and confident every step of the way. I’m so glad I checked this goal off my list—thank you for helping me look and feel amazing! 💖 P.S. You’re Meds are $20

      I had Lipo 360 surgery on 10/29/25, and my entire experience was amazing from start to finish. Every single person I interacted with was kind, attentive, and professional. The front desk staff were welcoming, and the anesthesia provider was incredibly sweet—he asked all the right questions, answered mine, and explained everything he was doing right up until I went under. My surgeon, Dr. Zachary Ok
