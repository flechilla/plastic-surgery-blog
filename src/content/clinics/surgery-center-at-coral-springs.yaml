If only more facilities had such great people like this I am sure more people would be less scared about having a procedure or surgery.  Th

      I recommend this place, all the staff is very friendly and polite. The nurses are the best, specially Grace,Serena and Julia. The girls at the front desk, Stella and Joanna, were very friendly. And last but not least, my anesthetist, Vanessa, was very sweet and made me feel less nervous.

From Stella, front desk, Monica & Lori my nurses, Bill and his whole anesthesiologist team, to my recovery nurses were fantastic not to mention everyone in-between. Dr. Nathaniel Thomas is top notch and in a class all by himself, and my physical therapist, Bronson (Flori

      I want to take a moment to say how pleased I was to have had exceptional care at this facility.  The staff is wonderful.  They are so kind,  thorough, accommodating, and considerate.

All of you did an outs
