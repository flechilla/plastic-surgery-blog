      Amazing Surgeon and Experience!  I had an explant and breast lift with Dr. Luis Viñas, and I couldn’t be happier. From my first consultation to my final follow-up, he and his team were caring, professional, and attentive. Dr. Viñas made me feel completely comfortable and explained everything clearly.  My results look beautiful and natural—I feel lighter, healthier, and more confident than ever. Th

      I underwent surgery with the doctor approximately four years ago. Unfortunately, I was never satisfied with the results from the beginning. A few months later, I returned for a revision procedure; however, it did not improve the outcome.  In my opinion, instead of enhancing the appearance of my eyes, the surgery worsened it. I had both upper and lower blepharoplasty, and rather than reducing the b

      I recently had an upper blepharoplasty with Dr. Vinas and I couldn’t be happier with my results! I look refreshed and natural, and the whole experience exceeded my expectations.

Working with him professionally, I see every day how charismatic, skilled, and comp

      You are lying,  i never  once said thai wanted to postpone for next year.  Even though I  posted the conversation between the office and myself,  you're still lying. I called and canceled the surgery several times. I even went to the office.  I talked to you Lisa in person, I even asked you if you want the new test results, i have thalassemia and sickle cell,  I'm not a candidate for elective surg

      I have used Dr Vinas on a few different occasions and all I can say is... he is the kindest, most caring, beyond skilled surgeon I've ever encountered.  He, and his sister Dr Yvette LaClaustra truly saved me. If you are looking for the most talented plastic surgeon with an "I hear you" bedside manner; look no further because he's right here. Thank you Dr Vinas for always being there for me. Facing
