      Evelyn was great with my post surgery massage. She was very friendly and I feel it was very helpful. I also did an IV which made me feel much better after the massage

      Dr Carvalho was absolutely amazing! He’s very friendly and very straight forward. So happy to have him for my third bbl. I was looking forward to it and he didn’t disappoint. I paid for the 6 massages and they definitely do an amazing job. I feel amazing after I have them.

      I had a wonderful experience with Dra. Ania and Dr. Yosdani. Both were extremely attentive and professional throughout my care. Their dedication to patient care really stood out — I never felt rushed, and they made sure I had the support I needed. I truly appreciate the compassion and professionalism they showed. Highly recommended!
