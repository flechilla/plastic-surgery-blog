      I recently had a microneedling session with Shaina, and I couldn’t be happier with the experience and results! From the moment I arrived, she made me feel completely comfortable and confident in the process. Shaina took the time to explain every step, what to expect, and how to care for my skin afterward. Her professionalism and attention to detail were outstanding.  The treatment itself was gentl

      Shaina was great!  She was very knowlegable about botox.  It was the quickest and most pain free botox I've ever had.  I cannot wait to see the results! Not only did she show me other areas to treat, she explained why I should treat those areas and what it would do.  Pricing was reasonable as well. We also talked about other services she offers and what they could do for me.  It was a great conver

      After following Shaina for years, I finally went to see her for liquid lipo. I felt so comfortable with her and absolutely trust what she says. She knows her stuff. She gave me her opinion of what she thought would be ideal for what I wanted, and of course I’m going to trust her after seeing her work. I’m so excited for my results and can’t wait to see her again for more enhancements! It’s hard to
