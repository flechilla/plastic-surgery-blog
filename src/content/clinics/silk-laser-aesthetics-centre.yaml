      I had an absolutely amazing experience here. My husband and I needed a little fine tuning so we went to see Dr. Astaphan.

      Dr.Astphan is pure brilliance with all he does, his knowledge is beyond. I have been a patient for over 15 years and can't imagine going anywhere else. He utilizes gold standard equipment and treatments and you will be so happy with the results. From injectables to laser hair removal I am more then happy with what I have seen. Plus Nicole at reception is always so kind.
