      I have been a customer at this dermatology clinic for about eight years. Over the years, I have purchased several treatment packages and procedures, and my experiences have been mixed.  I actually removed my previous review today because I recently had a few treatments left to use, and I decided to give the clinic another chance. I am genuinely glad I did. Today’s visit was a pleasant surprise in

      Every time I make an appointment they dont respect my time and I always end up waiting for one hour. They look like they dont care. They are very unprofessional. They walk around,  with coffee and water bottles, talking and forgetting about the clients. The laser is good but I will search for other clinic next time definitely where my time will be respected.

      I had an amazing experience at DermaClinic. María was my consultant, and she guided me through every step of the process with professionalism and care. Everything went smoothly from start to finish. I had a Lipo 360 procedure, and my results were truly amazing. I’m extremely satisfied and highly recommend DermaClinic and María for anyone considering cosmetic treatments.

      I do not know who’s rating this office but I do not believe these people at all. This place is absolutely horrible!! I went over a year ago to do threads and Fillers. The staff came in and out of the room during the procedure distracting the doctor to the point she was so distracted that a week later I went back to have the doctor confirm the threads did not work. Apologizing that she remembered m
