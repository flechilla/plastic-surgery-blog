      Dr. Amin is the absolute BEST!!! She showed my daughter so much care and thoroughly explained the surgery and how it went afterwards. I wish she could be her PCP. The office manager Autumn was sweet and prompt. Lovely office setting and excellent customer service.

      Nikki gives 100% to each patient as if they were the only one! Surgeons, Dr. Markley and Dr. Puglisi are exceptionally knowledgeable, compassionate and professional! I can’t imagine receiving better care than my daughter received from the team at South Florida Pediatric Surgeons!

What a relief!  5 stars for the Coral Springs offic

Dr Markley spent less than one minute in the exam room and was extremely dismissive. The front office staff was unprofessional and extremely aggressive; providing partial information, being extremely rude and rushing payment. The only positive is that an appointment

Half an hour is one thing, but 1hr is unacceptable and poor scheduling. There is 4 pages of paperwork to fill out if it’s your first time and they did not mention anything when I made the appointment along the lines of try to arrive early to complete all the pa
