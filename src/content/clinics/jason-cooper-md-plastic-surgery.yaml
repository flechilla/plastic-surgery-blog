      Dr Cooper is a highly skilled surgeon with unparalleled expertise. The breast implant removal procedure I underwent days ago has been positively life-changing, with minimal discomfort. I am amazed with the result and couldn’t be happier. Dr Cooper is an exceptional surgeon, a master artist and a genuinely caring physician.

      I am so impressed with Dr. Cooper and his whole staff. I went for a consultation a few months ago after several people, including 2 other Drs., recommended him for a mini face lift.
