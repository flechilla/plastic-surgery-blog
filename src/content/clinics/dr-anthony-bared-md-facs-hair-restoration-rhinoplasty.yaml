      I searched extensively for doctors across Florida and Latin America before choosing Dr. Bared, and I’m so glad I did. He was the most reasonably priced given his level of expertise, and I was extremely impressed by how many years he’s been practicing, his dedication to research, and his use of updated techniques.

From the moment I had my consultation to the day of my cast removal, everyone in the office was so kind and helpful. I was super nervous the day of surgery, but Rick, the anesthesiologist, was one of the nicest people ever. He made

      I had a very complex nose and had been nervous about finding the right surgeon, but I am so grateful I chose Dr. Bared. From the start, he was extremely thorough in explaining the procedure, realistic about expectations, and so genuine in the way he cared about my concerns. My nose was not an easy case, yet he approached it with such precision and artistry.  The entire process, from consultation t
