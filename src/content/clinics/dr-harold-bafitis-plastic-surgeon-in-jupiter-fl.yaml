      My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Bafitis since February 1994, and recently required his expertise again.  In September, Dr. Bafitis performed another double breast implant replacement procedure for me twenty four years after he did the original reconstruction following a mastectomy due to breast cancer.  The procedure was completed at a local hospital and I came home the next day with ex

      I met Dr. Bafitis in March 2024 for a consultation regarding surgery to remove excess skin following an extreme weight loss… I went from 410 lbs. to 225 lbs. Dr Bafitis exudes confidence and is very personable. He assured me that the results would be a transformation that I would be pleased with and that he would see me through all the necessary procedures. Dr Bafitis and his team treated me like

      The word Fantastic, unfortunately doesn't even come close to what I would like to use to describe his work and "bedside manor"  He genuinely cares and goes above and beyond for his patients.  Support staff can also make or break your experience, and his staff is extremely knowledgeable, helpful and very friendly.  I wouldn't even consider going elsewhere.
