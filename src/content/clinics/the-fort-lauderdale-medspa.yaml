      NP Caroline Dondi is an incredible injector. Ramsey and I both love coming to see her! Caroline has done a phenomenal job on my Botox and lip filler for a year now. Can’t recommend a better med spa in Fort Lauderdale.

      Caroline is truly exceptional. She is incredibly precise and has such an artistic eye. You can tell I had something done, but no one can ever figure out what because everything looks so natural and beautifully balanced. That’s the mark of a truly talented injector.  She is also so sweet, kind, and professional. She never pushes services on you, but instead takes the time to listen and thoughtfully
