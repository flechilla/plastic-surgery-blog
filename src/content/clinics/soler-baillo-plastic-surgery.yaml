      I cannot recommend Dr. Soler-Baillo enough. From the moment you walk in, his entire staff is warm, welcoming, and truly wonderful. As for Dr. Baillo-Soler himself—he is simply amazing. He is kind, empathetic, and so easy to talk to that he immediately makes you feel at home.  He was recommended to me by three people I personally know, and each of them knows at least five more who have had work don

      I just turned 30 and had my second and last child. I was dealing with my post partum body and decided to get a breast augmentation (implants) here! I initially spoke with Jennifer who was very kind, welcoming, and informative.

      ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ THE BEST! I was referred to Dr. Soler-Baillo years ago by a friend & former coworker, and I’m forever grateful she did! He’s an incredibly talented and experienced plastic surgeon (bonus - he has a great sense of humor), & my results are absolutely amazing. I’m completely SCAR FREE on my breasts since we did the incision through my armpit. I just left my 3rd lymphatic drainage massage,

      I am three weeks post-op after five procedures with Dr. Soler Baillo following a 100 lb weight loss, and I could not be happier. Every time I look in the mirror, I’m amazed! My confidence has been restored in ways I never thought possible.  Before surgery, I would move my skin around and try to imagine the results, but even then I couldn’t picture what he has achieved. The outcome has exceeded all

      I first became a patient of Dr. Soler-Baillo 15 years ago, and I have been consistently impressed and delighted with his work ever since. When it came time for a breast implant replacement, there was no question in my mind. I had to return to him because he truly is the best in the field. Once again, my experience exceeded all expectations. Dr. Soler-Baillo’s skill and artistry deliver beautifully
