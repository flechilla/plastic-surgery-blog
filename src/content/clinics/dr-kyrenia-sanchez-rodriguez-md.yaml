      Dr. Kyrenia Sanchez is truly one of a kind. From the very first time we spoke, I knew she was the right surgeon for me. I had been consulting with different doctors for two years, but the moment I talked to her, I just knew. She is compassionate, responsible, passionate, highly professional, and incredibly humble.

      I decided to try Botox treatments with Dr. Kyrenia, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. I invested a significant amount of time, money, and travel for this procedure, yet the results were not visible. Even after returning twice to give it another chance, the outcome did not improve. The product appeared either overly diluted or of poor quality, as some areas relaxed for only about
