      I had arrived late in the day after having moes surgery on my nose and needed a graft. They took me right in and Dr Kim gave me the option of waiting several weeks. I chose to have it done as I had a family event coming up.  He and his staff had a long day but they still went ahead and did the procedure. They were all so friendly and after every visit they took great care of me.  It’s been several

      The absolute worst experience of my life!! The staff was only interested in collecting my copay and Dr. Kim was so quick that he did procedure while I was sitting on chair. Threw a towel around my neck to cover me and needless to say I left his office covered in blood. My cyst was on the back of my head and blood was all over the front of my clothes. I never felt so devalued in all my life!! Nothi

      Dr. Kim has performed to procedures on me. He is by far one of the most intelligent and caring doctors I have ever worked with. I practice personal injury in Ft. Myers. When I have clients that need their scar examined, he is the first person I think of because of his compassion. He is patient oriented. His staff is EXCELLENT!!!
