      Everything you could want in a surgery center! I had an eye procedure done here and was beyond pleased with my experience. The nurse Maria and the whole team made me feel very comfortable and at ease. Maria explained all of my pre and post op instructions in detail and answered all of my questions. You are in great hands here!

      Had an amazing experience at New Image! Maria and Dr. Tran are absolutely fabulous, and the entire surgical team is wonderful. They took the time to thoroughly explain every step of the process and truly make you feel supported from start to finish. The care doesn’t stop after surgery either, and the post-op follow-ups are incredibly thoughtful and appreciated. I can’t recommend them enough!

      My experience here was nothing less than stellar. The surgery center is a warm and inviting place with staff who treat you like family. They explain everything very well and give detailed instructions about what you’re going to experience before and after your surgery. They are on call 24/7 for you  if you have problems or issues and will see you in the office as needed. I highly recommend New ima

      They took incredible care of me. It was a very cozy office and they were kind and very organized. I ended up puking quite a bit but they ensured I got the absolute best care and gave me the right meds to keep me balanced and solid enough to get home. They cared about my every need and ensured I was secure and not scared. Miss Maria was a lovely nurse as well and I couldn’t be more grateful for the
