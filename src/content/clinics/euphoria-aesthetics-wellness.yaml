      April has been amazing to work with! At my initial appointment she took her time going through everything I had filled out, listened to my concerns and went through all of her recommendations. She has been super responsive to questions and made me feel comfortable before starting treatments. I highly recommend April if you’ve been thinking about trying GLP-1!

      April is absolutely amazing! She really takes the time to listen to what you want/need for your health and beauty goals. I have been using her for over a year now and have been so pleased with her recommendations. She is very focused on all of your needs and takes the time to study lab work and go over it with you. We have built a wonderful client relationship and I trust her with all the advice a

      I have been receiving hormone pellets from April and the experience has been wonderful. April is very knowledgeable, has soft hands during procedure and communicates extremely well.  If you’re looking to feel better and be your best self- I’d recommend starting with April.

      I've been gping for a few months, and I can already see a noticeable difference—my skin looks so much more radiant and refreshed! April is truly amazing at what she does. Her space is cozy, welcoming, and makes you feel completely comfortable and cared for. It's such a personal and relaxing experience every time. Highly recommend if you're looking for real results and a touch of self-care!
