      Nothing but great things to say about Hochstein Medspa! The manager of the spa, Andrea, was very sweet and helpful. She was very welcoming and answered all my skincare questions. Melissa & Natalie are also great injectors, they made my sister feel so safe during her visit, walked her through all the steps, and made her feel so confident with her results!
