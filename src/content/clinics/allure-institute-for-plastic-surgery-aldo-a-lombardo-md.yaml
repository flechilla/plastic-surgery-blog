      I’m so thrilled with my progress after breast augmentation. Doc Lombardo truly exceeded my expectations and I’m so happy how they’re healing. Not just his work is exceptional, his entire staff are all wonderful. Jennifer, Brekkin, Sophie, and Robert are all so kind, helpful and friendly. They’re all very professional and I’m so glad I felt comfortable in an environment where it can be extremely ne
