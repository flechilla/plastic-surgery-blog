      I love coming here for my laser hair removal. I specifically request Rosie every time because she’s very friendly and informative. She makes me comfortable coming here to get an intimate service done since I get my full bikini area done. I like coming here over other med spas because they offer life time touch ups.

      I had my bikini and underarms treated with Judy, and I’m genuinely impressed with the results. The consultant was professional, gentle, and made the entire process feel comfortable from start to finish.

      I must say that I am disappointed. I deleted my previous review. Ideal Image promised me [ permanent ] hair removal. I stuck to the program for more than 1 year and completed all sessions, each within 6 weeks of eachother.  As things stand today - I still have dark hairs growing where they were lasered before. They are finer - but they are growing.  After my last session ended, they told me that I
