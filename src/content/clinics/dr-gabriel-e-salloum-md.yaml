      Words can’t express how grateful we are for Dr. Salloum. He was very patient and kind. He tended to my son’s facial laceration with such precision and had the best bedside manner. We never felt rushed and he took his time and did an amazing job. Rare to find a doctor that is skilled and patient these days. Thank you again.
