      I went in for an appointment and the care was excellent. The doctor was very honest with me and explained that I didn’t need the surgery I was considering. I truly appreciate his honesty and professionalism. You can tell he’s a quality physician who prioritizes the patient’s well-being, not just profit. I highly recommend him.

      As a plastic surgeon myself, I was willing to travel anywhere in the US to have a safe, high quality, predictable facelift result. I researched for over one year leading up to my decision to stay local with Dr. Baker. There was no need to travel. I am now six months post-op and extremely satisfied with my results. Dr. Baker's focused attention to even the smallest details before, during and after
