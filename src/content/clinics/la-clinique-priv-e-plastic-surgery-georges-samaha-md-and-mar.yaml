      I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Mario Samaha. From the moment I had my first consultation, I knew I had chosen him to perform my breast augmentation. It was a very difficult decision for me, as I had never had any type of surgery before, and this would be my first time in an operating room. Feeling trust and confidence in my surgeon was extremely important to me. I did all my r

      I cannot begin to explain how amazing Dr. Mario is. From the initial consultation, he made me feel so at ease that I did not even consult with any other surgeon after talking to him.

The staff and entire team were amazing and so

      Let me start by saying this: Dr. Mario Samara is THAT doctor. Miami has a reputation when it comes to BBLs, and I already knew what lane I wanted to be in. I wanted to be a BBL princess — not a BBL warrior — so honestly, he was the only option.  Dr. Samara did my lipo, BBL, chin lipo, and arm lipo, and the results are incredible. Sculpted, feminine, and natural, the kind of work where people just

      After evaluating several surgeons, I decided to undergo a tummy tuck and breast augmentation with Dr. Georges Samaha, and I can say with complete certainty that it was the best decision.  From the very first consultation, Dr. Samaha was clear, honest, and realistic. He does not offer unrealistic bodies; he offers natural and healthy results. As a 46-year-old woman, I deeply appreciated that he too
