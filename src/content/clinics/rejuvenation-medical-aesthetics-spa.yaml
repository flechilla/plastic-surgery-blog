      I had an amazing experience at Rejuvenation Medical Center today. I received Morpheus8 with PRP layered on top, and the treatment was very thorough and well explained. I also had 50 units of Botox and half a syringe of lip filler, and I couldn’t be happier with the results. Everything was done with great care, professionalism, and attention to detail. The environment is clean, welcoming, and comfo

      Julia Cubas did my eyebrows (microblading) and they turned out amazing! She’s truly the best, she took great care with every detail, explained the entire process beforehand, and gave me clear aftercare instructions. Absolutely recommended, this review is well deserved! The service at this place is top notch, I felt like a VIP!

      Rejuvenation Spa has truly exceeded my expectations! I’ve tried other places for laser hair removal before, but nothing compares to the results I’m getting here. After just two sessions, my skin is incredibly smooth and almost hair-free—even with my naturally thick hair. Venetia and Maria are amazing! They’re kind, attentive, and make every visit feel comfortable and personal. The treatments have

      I honestly couldn’t be happier with the results of my lip fillers! From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and completely at ease — the staff was professional, knowledgeable, and really listened to what I wanted. I was going for a natural, plump look that still felt like me, and that’s exactly what I got!  The procedure was quick and surprisingly comfortable. There was minimal swelling, and w
