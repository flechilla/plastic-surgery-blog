      Irena was absolutely wonderful! I booked an appointment with her for facial capillary removal. She made me feel so comfortable and the procedure was super quick and easy!  In minutes my face looked so much clearer! Will be back soon!!!

      I’ve done IPL laser on both my chest and face and the results are absolutely amazing. My most recent treatment was the vascular non-invasive laser on my face. That treatment cleared red spots on my face instantly. The entire team from Victoria at the front desk to Irena who does my treatments are amazing. I highly recommend going here for any treatment!

      This is after just one session, and I’m already so impressed with the results. The pain was minimal—far less than I expected—and the entire experience was incredibly comfortable. The owner is not only knowledgeable but also extremely kind and welcoming, which made the whole process even better. I’m excited to continue my tattoo removal journey here.

      Irena is fabulous!  She really helped me with sun spots and redness on my face and neck from sun damage with the IPL laser.  She is very professional and knows what she is doing.  Pricing is very fair. The office is clean and comfortable.  The receptionist is very kind and friendly as well 😁 Great experience!
