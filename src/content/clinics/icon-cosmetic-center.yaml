      Dr. Moradian is an exceptional cosmetic surgeon. His attention to detail is truly immaculate, and I couldn’t be happier with my results. He performed a breast lift with augmentation, BBL, lipo 360, J-Plasma 360, and chin lipo — and each procedure exceeded my expectations beyond measure.  He knew exactly what I envisioned and brought it to life with perfection. His entire staff is incredibly friend
