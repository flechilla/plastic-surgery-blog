      I’ve been going to Dr. Handal for Botox and lip filler for a year. I recently used Ericka & she is truly exceptional. I’m uber impressed with both my results and the experience.

He immediately reassured me, saying, “No problem—come in and I’ll fit you in.” I visited the office three days later and was welcomed with genuine warmth. My appointment was around noon, and afterward I was even invited to j
