      My appointment was at 1pm and I was seen at 1pm. Love an office that stays on top of their schedule. Did a full body exam of my moles, doctor was sweet and thorough, checked each one and took photos to refer to for follow up appointments. Easy check in and check out.

      Dr. Klem demonstrates outstanding clinical knowledge and takes the time to listen carefully, explain diagnoses clearly, and ensure that patients feel informed and supported in their care. Their approach is both thorough and thoughtful, and I have always felt that my health and well-being were treated as a genuine priority. Front desk very friendly. I strongly recommend
