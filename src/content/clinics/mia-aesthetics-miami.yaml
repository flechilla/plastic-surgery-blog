      Abigale at Mia Aesthetics is amazing! Helped me coordinate with the Dr and assured me through out this process. Cosmetic surgery is a huge process and having some one help you in a kind professional manner was so helpful in easing my mind. I’d recommend Abigale to anyone looking to go through mia for your cosmetic surgery needs. I’m more than happy I chose Mia to do my surgery

      I flew from California to see Dr. Giorgis, and it was the best decision. The nursing staff is wonderful, and the CRNA really helped calm my nerves while I was being put under. If you are traveling for surgery, know that you’ll be in great hands here. I’m 4 days post-op now and recovering well—I can’t wait to see the full results. I’ll be recommending this team to everyone I know!
