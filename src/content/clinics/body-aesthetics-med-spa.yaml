      I came to Body Aesthetics Med Spa after my liposuction 360 for post care (lymphatic drainage). Dime is such a great person. Her place is clean and the atmosphere is so welcoming. She is very professional and gentle while providing care. She took her time to massage me and made sure that I was comfortable at all times. I will definitely come back for other services that she offers.
