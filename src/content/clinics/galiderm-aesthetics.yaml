      I absolutely love this med spa.. I always have an amazing experience with Cigdem and my Botox treatments.. I recently signed up for a laser treatment with Meg Brewster, I’ve never had a laser this intense before.. Meg made me feel so comfortable and did a phenomenal job! I actually just enjoyed my time talking and laughing with her through it.. I highly recommend Meg and Cigdem, they’re the best
