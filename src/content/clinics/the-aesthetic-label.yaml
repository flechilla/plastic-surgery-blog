      Danielle is absolutely amazing! Her professionalism shines through in every step of the process, and she immediately makes you feel comfortable and at ease. She has an incredible skill set and a true eye for detail—she injected filler in my cheeks and chin which restored my facial balance perfectly.

      Amazing, great team and Danielle is very welcoming and informative on her stuff. I got lip filler and they turned out amazing. Danielle was recommended to me by a friend and I will continue to recommend her to all my friends as I already have been doing. I trust her and I will definitely be going back.

      Danielle is an amazing injector!! She’s so knowledgeable, patient and kind!! She’s the real OG for facial balancing!!! Highly recommend her if you’re thinking of plump lips, facial symmetry, Botox and more! And her assistant Kaitlyn who handles all scheduling is very professional and very kind. She’s a breath of fresh air whether you’re  communicating with her over a call or text!
