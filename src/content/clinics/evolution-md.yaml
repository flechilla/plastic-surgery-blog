      Exceptional Experience at Evolution MD with Dr. Lipo  From day one, my experience at Evolution MD has been absolutely exceptional. From the moment I scheduled my consultation, through all of my pre-operative appointments and blood work, to the day of my surgery (which was just yesterday), everything was handled with the highest level of professionalism, care, and attention to detail.  Dr. Lipo is

      I’ve been following MD Evolution since 2016, and this year I finally mustered up the courage to move forward with the procedure I’ve wanted for so long — a breast lift. From the moment I walked in, every single staff member made me feel safe, seen, and genuinely cared for.  Their professionalism, patience, and kindness exceeded every expectation. They answered every question, calmed every worry, a

      The surgery with Dr. Lipo was amazing. I had Lipo 360 life of the arms and the chin. I cannot say that I had any pain because it did not hurt. It was just a very sore feeling. The staff is great. The massages are also very good the only negative I would say would be the Faja that they sell there. It is not at all comfortable. I highly recommend you bring your own Faja.

Everyone was so informative, extremely polite, and genuinely caring. They made me feel safe, supported, and well taken care of every step of the way.  Doctor Lee was an absolute sweetheart—super, super, super sweet, very informative, and so reassuring. I truly f
