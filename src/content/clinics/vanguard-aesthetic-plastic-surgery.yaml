      Being diagnosed with breast cancer was hard, but the professionalism and encouragement received from Dr. Weiss and his staff was encouraging and gave me peace of mind that I was in good hands through this process. The end result from my surgeries has been more than excellent. Highly recommended Dr. Weiss and the whole office staff.

      Dr. Dreszer is truly the best, and I’m beyond grateful I chose him for my tummy tuck and breast augmentation. I had other consultations lined up, but after my very first visit with him, I knew I didn’t need to see anyone else. He made me feel completely comfortable, really listened to what I wanted, and explained everything without trying to upsell or pressure me in any way. I was referred to him,

      I cannot speak highly enough about Dr Dreszer, he’s truly one of the most compassionate, knowledgeable, and dedicated doctors I’ve encountered. From the first appointment, he made me feel heard and genuinely cared for. He explained everything clearly and made sure I felt comfortable every step of the way. His staff and team were exemplary and knowledgeable about all areas.
