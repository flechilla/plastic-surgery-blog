      I am beyond happy with my results, even just 2 weeks post-op! Part of my decision to choose CRS was because of their incredible staff, and they truly exceeded my expectations.  Patricia at the front desk is always so lovely to work with. Claudia made the entire decision-making process seamless—she was kind, thorough, and consistently reassured me that my safety was the top priority, which proved t

      Dr. Michael Cheung is exceptional.  I have been seeing Dr. Cheung for 10 months due to Breast Cancer with BRCA1+ gene mutation.  First a Lumpectomy, then a double mastectomy with expanders and I just had my expanders to permanent implants finished last week.

      Dr. Cheung is absolutely amazing, I am so glad I traveled to visit him. Best bedside manner, very knowledgeable, made me feel at ease. His work is what drew me to book with him, and just a week afterwards and I’m already impressed with my results. It was also very easy to setup all my appointments both in person and over the phone. The whole team at office is so sweet! I was worried about doing al
