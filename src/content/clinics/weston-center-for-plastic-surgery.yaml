      Awesome experience at Weston Plastic surgery center. I had a minor procedure done. Dr. Eberle made me feel comfortable, relaxed throughout.  He is very good natured with an earthy way of explaining each step. Office staff also welcoming and friendly. Recommend highly.

      Went to Dr. Eberle for a breast augmentation consultation, and just wow! Not only was he thorough with how the entire surgical process goes, but he took the time to explain each type of implant and the different materials. He made me feel comfortable and heard. And his nurses and staff are amazing! Everyone is so sweet and welcoming!
