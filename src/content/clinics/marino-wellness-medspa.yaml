      Lisbeth was amazing. She explained the good and the bad about this journey I’m about to make. I felt comfortable with the first time visit. Very confident that I will accomplish my goal. Will pass on the word about Marino Wellness

      I've been using them for the last month and I couldn't be happier. I live out of state and get my meds on time. Lisbeth is a doll. Very patient, always trying to help you so your progress of losing those unwanted pounds are easy and smooth. Thank you! I just order my second dose and looking forward to more pounds away. Recommend them 100%
