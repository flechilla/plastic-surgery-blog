      Dr. G is truly the BEST. I’ve been to other places for injectables before, but I immediately noticed a difference in both the quality of care and the results.

      I moved from NYC to Boca a little under three years ago. When I first arrived, one of my top priorities was finding the right injector.

      Dr. G has helped me regain my confidence!  Using Botox and fillers, she has lessened my deep lines and has softened my wrinkles.  I look naturally younger and more refreshed!  The staff at Dr. G’s is amazing.  They are always so lovely and helpful.   The experience of getting some facial “help” is easy and painless.  I highly recommend Dr.   G’s med spa!
