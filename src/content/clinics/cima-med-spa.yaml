I was a bit on the fence, but after this week of being sick and drained and with a three-year-old running around I really needed a pick me up.

      Love this spa! The staff is so friendly and makes you feel comfortable about your procedures. I also love how honest they are. Marcella is very open and honest if she doesn’t think you need a certain procedure or will recommend something that’s better for the outcome you’re looking for!
