      Just had my post-op appointment today with Dr. JC Alvarez, and I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH MY RESULTS!! He completed my surgery 2 weeks ago, and it's been an extremely smooth healing process. From the moment we had our pre-op consult, he was extremely realistic and provided me with my DREAM RESULTS!! Special mention to all the nurses on his team as well that are extremely caring!!
