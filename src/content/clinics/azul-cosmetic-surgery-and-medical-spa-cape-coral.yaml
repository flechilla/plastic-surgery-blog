      Prices are a bit on the higher side of the market rate but Jordyn is fantastic! Having a skilled injector is crucial when having procedures done to your face! Her skill level is top notch! She's honest and gives valuable feedback.  She discusses all the options and helps you make an informed decision.  She's amazing! I can't recommend her enough!

      Natalie was amazing! She is extremely knowledgeable about skincare and took her time to make sure everything was done thoroughly. She explained things clearly, was very attentive, and truly cares about providing an excellent experience. My Hydrafacial was incredible and my skin looked and felt amazing after. Highly recommend her!

      I love Azul & Jordyn. She really takes her time to answer any questions & explain things to you. I love my results !!  I previously went to a different place when I just started injections & I never liked my final results. It never felt fully finished  and would quickly taper off in 2 weeks. I finally decided to take a leap & try Azul. I do pay more now BUT it’s totally worth it. My results look A

      She is great! Hydra facial w/ derma planing. My skin feels wonderful - like it’s breathing anew. She explains what she is doing. She gave me insights to my skin - and how to keep it glowing. The best aesthetician I’ve had .
