      I cannot say enough amazing things about Dr. Zuri and his entire staff.

From the very beginning, I felt completely comfortable and confident in his care. You can truly tell that Dr. Z genuinely loves what he does. He’s incredibly talente

      This is my second time coming back to Dr. Zuri, and I don’t regret it one bit. He is truly top notch, and so is his entire staff. From the first consultation to after surgery, they make sure you are well taken care of every step of the way. The level of care before and after surgery is exceptional. Hands down, the best plastic surgeon in Miami.

      Highly Recommend Dr. Zuri and Zuri Plastic Surgery  I’m currently one week post-op after a major surgical procedure with Dr. Zuri, and I couldn’t be happier with my experience so far. Dr. Zuri and his entire team have been absolutely wonderful. I was very nervous about undergoing surgery, but they made me feel comfortable, informed, and supported every step of the way.  Before choosing Dr. Zuri, I
