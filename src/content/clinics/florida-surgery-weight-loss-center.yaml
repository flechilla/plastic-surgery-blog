      Dr. Terushkin and his staff are GREAT!!! From my initial consultation to my post-operative care, he and his team were phenomenal. The surgery went smoothly, and my recovery has been exactly as described, with minimal pain. I was back to my daily routine the next day. Choosing him as my surgeon was a great decision. I would definitely recommend.

      I am a 30-year-old woman who decided to undergo the TOre bariatric surgery after regaining weight following the birth of my two children. I was struggling with my health and hoped this procedure would be the quickest and most effective way to lose the weight and feel better again.
