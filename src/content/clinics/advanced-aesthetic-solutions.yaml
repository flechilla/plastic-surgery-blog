      I can’t say enough great things about Cassie. She is a nurse practitioner with extensive experience in critical care and orthopedics, and it truly shows in the level of skill and confidence she brings to her work. She performed PRP injections for my thinning hair as well as micro needling on my face and neck, and the results have been fantastic.  My skin has noticeably improved in tone and overall

      I’ve been getting regular Botox treatments for the past 7 years and recently started seeing Cassie at Advanced Aesthetic Solutions. She is friendly, informative, professional, and a fantastic injector! The facility is clean, quiet, and relaxing. I’ve had nothing but positive experiences and will continue to see her for my Botox.

      I’ve recently visited the office for a facial with Melody. She was honestly the sweetest and was so informed. She heard what concerns I had and even gave me recommendations for what to use at home. I also did a consultation with Cassie for filler/botox. I will definitely be scheduling an appointment with her. She seemed so well informed and understood my needs. I would 10/10 recommend this place !

      Cassie is absolutely wonderful. She does a great job every time and never tries to oversell treatments you don’t need. She takes a very thoughtful, medical-professional approach and really pays attention to everything that matters. I always feel confident, well cared for, and never rushed. Highly recommend her.
