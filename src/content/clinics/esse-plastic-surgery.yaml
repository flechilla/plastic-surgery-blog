      Lindsey was awesome, she made me feel like I was the only patient she had. She made me feel comfortable, I enjoyed her company, she made my procedure so calming and she reasured me everytime.  During recovery she checked on me none stopped and made sure I was healing properly and comfortable, she was so kind and pleasant. If anyone wanted to do miradry, Lindsey is your girl. Let's not forget Adra

      I got the Mira Dry treatment done with Lindsay and I’m very happy! Not only was the treatment successful, but her bedside manner was amazing. She also checked in on me not once, but twice days after the treatment. She was professional, informative, calming, and just truly amazing from beginning to end. I would highly recommend this treatment with Lindsay to everyone!

Lindsay is amazing, very professional and knowledgeable. She made the procedure comfortable and easy to get through. She also checked up on me after the surgery to see how I was doing. I had a great experie

      Dr Stokes is the best!  I love what she did to beautify me.  The attention to detail is amazing.  Follow up fantastic.  Skin tightening sessions by Lindsay were the icing on the cake.  These ladies are wonderful and you will be grateful like i am.
