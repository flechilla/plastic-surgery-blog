      My experience with Meika was awesome!  I just scheduled my second Morpheus 8 treatment and I’m looking forward to seeing even more results. Meika is knowledgeable, trustworthy and overall great to be around. Go Maven studio!!

      I had an RF lifting procedure for my face and neck with Meika, and I absolutely loved it! She was very professional and kind, and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire session. Everything was super clean and nicely arranged. I’m very happy with the results and definitely recommend her!

      Came in for my first micro needling appt and it was pure magic. The procedure was painless and had no issues after. The office is clean and cute. Meika was straight forward about pricing and open to any questions I had, which I really appreciated. No beating around the bush or surprises! I highly recommend Maven Aesthetics! You won't be disappointed

      I had an excellent experience with Meika at Maven Aesthetics. She guided me through the entire Morpheus8 process, providing clear information and thoughtful recommendations about the areas that would benefit most. I highly recommend her for Morpheus8 treatments and am excited to see the final results!
