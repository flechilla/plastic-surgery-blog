      I have been seeing Kathy for my aesthetic needs the past 2 years so I of course came to see her at the brand new Pines Aesthetics location in Cooper City. Besides the office being absolutely gorgeous, all of the staff is amazing and attentive to your needs and questions. Kathy is very professional and gives the best recommendations to keep me looking young and rejuvenated. Highly recommend!
