      My experience was extremely disappointing. On the day of the procedure, I waited over 7 hours it was scheduled for 11am and I wasn’t seen until 6pm.

      Dr. Balto was amazing. He made me feel super calm throughout the whole process and gave honest, no-pressure recommendations. Everything went quickly and smoothly, couldn’t have asked for a better experience.
