      I do not know where to begin with my review with Dr Faramand however I can definitely recommend this artist that has transformed my face. Being in the medical field and doing the research that I did before choosing my surgeon this surgeon is an artist. From the very first pre-op appointment online all the way to the end of my surgery journey she has been phenomenal! Her staff from Jessica to Margi

I followed the doctors rest

      Dr Farahmand and staff were excellent. They answered every question and truly made you feel comfortable when you entered the front door. The results were beyond my expectations from the actual surgery through recovery. I couldn’t have asked for more. Any time during recovery or before surgery I could  email a question to Dr or staff and usually had answer within an hour or two. The attention to de
