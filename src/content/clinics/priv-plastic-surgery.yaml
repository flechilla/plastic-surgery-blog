      Dr. Wu is truly exceptional! She performed both my breast reconstruction and my facial cosmetic surgery, and the results are natural, beautiful and exceeded my expectations.

      It has been a pleasure to be Dr Wu’s patient after mastectomy. She had an exquisite eye for detail and beauty. I feel lucky and blessed. All my other doctors and nurses think she is the best of the best! She and her staff are caring, loving, and just fabulous! 🌈🙏❤️

      I recently underwent reconstructive surgery with Dr Wu.   I could not be happier with the results. She explained in detail from the beginning ,how my surgery was going to be and made me feel very comfortable.I barely had any post operative pain. She is such a skilled surgeon and I feel so lucky I went to her. Ariella and Gabriella had been so helpful through my whole process as well. Thank you Dr
