      Great deals for post op surgery! I got the same lady for my massages and the last massage they were so booked that I she couldn’t take me so I got another one. Both did an amazing job draining me out and being careful with my body as well. They informed me and gave me couple of tips too so I could get a fast recovery. Service was always good in this place.

      Had two Lymphatic Massages. One with Gladys and the second with Arelis. They both did a fantastic job and gave me so many tips that I am so grateful. They took the time massaging my back then my stomach for my Tummy Tuck. They are very professional and love the spa. It is very clean and the staff is wonderful. I highly recommend them.
