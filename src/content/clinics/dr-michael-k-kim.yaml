      In just 5.5 weeks, I’ve lost 6 inches!  As a 59-year-old woman navigating menopause and undergoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT), I've always struggled with my body shape, weighing 125 pounds and consuming around 1500 calories daily.

      I recently had Dr. Kim remove a cyst I had on the back of my head for the last 10 years. I had no pain at all during or after the procedure. Dr. Kim and his staff were very professional, friendly and made me feel at ease. I wish I would have had this removed a long time ago, I'm glad it's gone. Thank you Dr. Kim.

I selected Dr. Michael Kim to help me fix the screwed up

      Dr. Kim is wonderful. Over the years i have had many cysts on my head removed from different doctors. Dr Kim is the best. Never any post op pain. Healed great with dissolvable sutures that never bothered me at all. Also had many keratosis removed with great results. His staff is great too! Wouldn’t go anywhere else now!
