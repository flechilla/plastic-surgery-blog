      You can trust her! She is patient, calm, informative, and conducts a very safe practice. She is kind and very professional while very personable! It is a fun visit!

Over the past 2 years I’ve received micro-needling with exosomes, Dysport injections, and the VI Peel— the results have been incredible. Limor is not only highly skilled and knowledgeable, but also such a pleasure to be around! Her warm and professional approach makes every visit enj
