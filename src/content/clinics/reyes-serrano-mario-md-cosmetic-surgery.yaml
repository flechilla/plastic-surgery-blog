      I had an amazing experience with Dr.Reyes he did my lipo with fat transfer for my BBL both which came Out beautifully. He did my surgery at Jolie Plastic when they were open. He listened and answered all my questions. I will definitely have surgery done with him again.

      After a long search for the best plastic surgeon I've decided to go with Dr. Mario Reyes-Serrano. I am so glad I selected him. He did a wonderful job on my procedure. His staff are absolutely amazing friendly and professionals. They were available at anytime with anything that I needed before and after my surgery. They help me feel relaxed and secured. The clinic is clean and private. I am so plea

      Dr. Reyes-Serrano and the team at Larkin Community Hospital did a fabulous job. I had a tummy tuck done and I was very nervous and they comforted me and made sure I was well. The staff and nurses at the office also made sure that all my questions were answered and everything was explained to me. Its 2 weeks since my surgery and everyone tells me how well my surgery looks. I am very happy
