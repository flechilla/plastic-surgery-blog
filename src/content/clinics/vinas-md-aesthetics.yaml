      I consulted with DR Marisa Vinas about ways to make my face look younger, more bright. We decided on the Erbium laser package. My face looks amazing the combination of treatments was perfection. Less freckles, less age spots, less redness, less wrinkles and that was only the first treatment. Today I had my 2nd treatment and I’m so excited because I know the results will be incredible.

      Dr. Vinas recently did my wife’s “brunch lips” all I can say is WOW! She did an amazing job. If you have any cosmetic surgery needs I strongly suggest you call Dr. Vinas.
