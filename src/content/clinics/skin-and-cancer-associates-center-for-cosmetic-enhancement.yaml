      I feel very fortunate that Dr Nester is my physician. They provide me with excellent atttentive service. Very aware of appointment managing times. Knowledgeable of techniques used and they take time to explain things when asked. I have always felt comfortable for all my appointments. The care that Dr. Nester takes for his staff  has always impressed me. I do enjoy going to see him.

      Doctor Nestor is crackerjack, Johnny-on-the-spot, very sharp alert, and knows his stuff. And  the office staff are kind, yet professional, and very knowledgeable. Scheduling was a breeze, as was the appointment time with the doctor.

      My 1 stop to manage pain and solutions given for my continued well being and a body that functions. My Pain doctor is so qualified, intuitive, studied, realistic, like a miracle maker.  Over a year visiting this medical office and leaving more educated and informed everytime.

      Highly recommend this place! Nice, clean, fast, friendly staff and very professional!  EDIT: they made big claims to my insurance, never showed me their quotes and simply sent me a big bill to pay. This is not a good way to do business.
