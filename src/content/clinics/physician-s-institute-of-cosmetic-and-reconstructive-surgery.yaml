He demonstrated a high level of professionalism, clinical expertise, and compassion throughout my care. The procedure progressed smoothly, was well managed, and I felt informed and supported at every stage.  The recovery has been easy and

      There are no words to express my gratitude to Dr. Weiser and his staff! I first consulted with Dr. Weiser 12 years ago after I was diagnosed with breast cancer. He came highly recommended. Him and his staff showed such compassion during a very difficult time. Whenever I am examined by other doctors they always express to me what a phenomenal job my surgeon did!! I highly recommend Dr. Weiser and D

They made me feel comfortable, informed, and supported thr

      Recently had a tummy tuck with lipo with Dr. Weiser. Fist off let me just say I booked with him off bedside manner alone without even seeing his work. The man is top tier in my opinion. He is funny, and just amazing. He helps me into my fajas what doctor does that???? He meet me next day after the surgery and helped me out of the car and back in. No matter when I call he sees me. I am so satisfied

      There are truly no words for how thankful I am for Dr. Weiser and his team. I am a complex case and have undergone multiple surgeries with other providers, and from start to finish, Dr. Weiser has been compassionate, thorough, and someone I wholeheartedly trust. This surgery was smooth, complication-free, and resulted in my fastest recovery yet. The outcome is something I’ve wished for for nearly
