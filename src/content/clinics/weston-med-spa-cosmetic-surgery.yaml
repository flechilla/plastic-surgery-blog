      Klara truly has magic hands! I’m absolutely loving my Botox results so natural and fresh. She’s incredibly detail-oriented and makes you feel completely at ease during the whole process. You can tell she genuinely cares and takes her time to get everything just right. Can’t recommend her enough!

      So happy we finally have someone like Klara in Weston! She’s not only incredibly skilled with all the best techniques, but also has the sweetest personality. I’ve done BBL laser, Botox, and filler with her — and everything turned out amazing. Highly recommend!

      A very nice place, the attention of staff is good, the Dr. who attended me incredible. The waiting time is very long, but it really does not get heavy.
