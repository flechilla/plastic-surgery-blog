      My experience from beginning to end was absolutely pleasant. From the time I left a deposit to the very end when I had my last massage. All of the staff is so pleasant and kind. I had lipo 360 with Dr.Sadio and she is so pleasant and also the anesthesiologist that worked alongside her they were both so very warm and made me feel safe going under. Dr.Sadio shaped me so well. The staff that helped m

      Wouldn’t recommend this place at all. Everybody is nice to you before you pay and after your procedure your out the door right away they don’t care about you at all. They would also try to charge more money when you get there even though they said everything is included. The doctors are nice but the staffs are rude and careless . Especially post-op the nurses don’t ever answer your questions or co
