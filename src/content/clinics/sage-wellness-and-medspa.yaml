      I completely trust Yvette — she’s a true professional. Before finding her, I had visited several aesthetics clinics, and none of them were able to give me the solution I needed. Yvette is incredibly committed, and most importantly, she genuinely cares about your well-being, not about profit like many others in South Florida. Every time I discuss a treatment with her, she focuses on finding the bes

She’s knowledgeable, professional, and genuinely cares about helping me reach my skincare goals. I highly recommend the Matrix Pro treatment — the results have been fantastic! I really appreciate Yvette for making this such a positive and comfortable

      Yvette and Acsa are the absolute best!! I am so lucky to have been recommended to Sage Wellness.

      Yvette is amazing, knowledgeable, and you can tell she thoroughly enjoys what she does. She provides an initial consultation and then discusses and explains what treatments she recommends and what to expect. I am an nurse as well, and it’s very important to me that anyone providing any type of care to me is knowledgeable and I trust them…and she has a great personality to top it off! I highly high

      I was referred by a good friend who has been coming here over a year. I have lost 35 lbs with Yvette and Acsa's help. They are both so helpful, kind and knowledgeable.  I look forward to my appointments and always have a positive visit.  The prices are very reasonable and I find scheduling my appointments easy and my treatments are affordable. Thank you ladies for your help in reaching my goal!
