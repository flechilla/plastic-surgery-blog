      Dr Dabbah is an extremely skilled Surgeon. He’s excellent at his craft. I needed a large percentage of my forehead opened up and a skin lesion removed and my scar is practically invisible and it’s only been a few months. I would highly recommend him. The ladies in the office couldn’t be sweeter and more helpful. If you’re looking for a great surgeon in the Palm Beach area, he’s your man.
