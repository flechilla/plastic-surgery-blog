      Jacquie did my lips and it didn’t hurt at all. She left them gorgeous! My face looks so harmonious, and my lips… just perfect. She is incredibly gentle and careful throughout the entire process. I also got Botox and I was thrilled—not only with the results, but also with the kind and professional attention. I love the space; it makes you feel relaxed the moment you walk in. Highly recommended ✨💖
