      I’ve been doing laser hair removal at Bare MedSpa in Boca Raton and recently tried their new Edgewater location, both were amazing! Super clean, cute spaces and the tech always made me feel really comfortable. Nothing beats these results for this price, highly recommend if you’re thinking about laser!
