      The best medical spa in South Florida! It’s just recently opened in Hallandale Beach, very clean, luxurious environment and such a nice staff. I came here for a laser hair removal, the process was very smooth, not painful. They’re a lot of different varieties of services and I can’t wait to come again here. Definitely worth it!
