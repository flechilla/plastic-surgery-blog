      Neogenix in Boca has been a Godsend. I am so happy I met Sasha Connolly and her team as they helped me navigate through health and beauty. Very professional, and elegant offices. I will be a client for life!! And especially thank you for helping me lose 35lbs with the semiglutide program, aaaamazing (I’ve been off it now for 3 months and I haven’t regained any weight).

      Great experience! Sasha is great, very friendly. She was able to work me in to their schedule. She is also very knowledgeable about the processes they offer. Vanessa was spectacular. She takes extra care explaining everything and focused on my areas of concern. Zero selling or pressure. Plus she made the “Botox” very quick and painless.
