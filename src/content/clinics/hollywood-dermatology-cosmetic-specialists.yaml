Her assistant was equally wonderful—efficient, friendly, and supportive throughout

      I had my appointment with Dr. Danielle Nicolazo, and it was truly wonderful. From the moment I arrived, everyone treated me with great kindness, and the whole process was fast, I didn’t have to wait at all. The doctor’s assistant was also very sweet and polite. But the best part was Dr. Danielle herself,  she was incredibly kind and gentle, took the time to ask me questions, and made me feel calm
