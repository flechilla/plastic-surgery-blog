      Juliette was amazing at the initial consult and throughout the entire process. She sat with me and listened to my desires then gave her analysis of what would be best for me and talked me through each step. Painless and optimal results! Couldn’t ask for a better injector and experience. Highly recommend Juliette and look forward to trying other services with her in the future.
