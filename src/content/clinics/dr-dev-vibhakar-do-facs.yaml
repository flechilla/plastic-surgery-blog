      I cannot say enough wonderful things about Dr. Dev and his entire office. From the very first consultation through my explant surgery and recovery, I felt truly seen, heard, and cared for.

      Dr. Dev Vibhakar has been one of the best medical experiences I’ve ever had. I decided to undergo breast explant surgery and came in with a lot of fear, knowing that one of my implants had ruptured. As a woman, I was also very concerned about the aesthetic outcome.

      The best ever! I don't trust doctors and haven't for the past 15 years because of something that happened that doesn't pertain to this review. BUT. I haven't been to an actual MD since then, only ND's, that's how much I don't trust. However, I've known that I needed to get these toxic bags out of my body. I don't even drink from plastic, yet I had these in my body, because I didn't know better whe
