      Dr. Khouri and his staff have been so great over the years I have been going to him for breast reconstruction. It is a difficult journey but they make it a more positive experience. My results are amazing and I know I would not have gotten these same results with just implants or flap procedures.

      I have been a patient of Dr. Khouri since 2020.  In 2002, I had a left-side mastectomy, with TRAM flap reconstruction, followed by chemo and radiation.  In 2016, cancer was detected in my right side, having a mastectomy.  Chemo and radiation was not necessary.  To match my left side, I opted for an implant.  Eventually, I felt I developed BII.  In 2019, I received a letter stating my implants gave
