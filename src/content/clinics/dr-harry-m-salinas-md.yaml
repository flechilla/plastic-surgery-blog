      I have had the most incredible experience with Dr. Salinas and his entire staff from initial consult through post-op! My experience was nothing short of professional, warm, and attentive. Not to mention how thrilled I am with the results of my upper and lower bleph. I had absolutely no pain and expect to have no scarring! Couldn’t recommend him enough!
