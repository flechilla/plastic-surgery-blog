      I underwent a brow lift, upper blepharoplasty,  and neck lift with Dr. Agarwahl in December 2024. My experience has been absolutely stellar!  Dr. Agarwahl is kind, caring and extremely patient.  He really took the time to listen to all of my concerns and went above and beyond to address every single one of them. His entire office staff is truly wonderful too!

From the initial consultation to the follow-up, the entire experience was exceptional.  Dr Agarwal was attentive, knowledgeable, and made me feel completely at ease. The results are natural and beautiful — exactly what I was hoping for. I look refreshed and more
