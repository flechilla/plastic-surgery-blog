      First time here and I just had my massage Delma was amazing. I told her I had lower back pain, and she really focused on it and released all the tension. The atmosphere is beautiful and so relaxing. A must-visit if you want to truly unwind!

      We were visiting Miami and visited this spa for a couples Swedish massage. I highly recommend them to anyone! It was one of the best massages I’ve ever had!  She was very thorough and found area of tightness and worked them out. It was so relaxing.  My husband says the same. If I’m ever in Miami again I will definitely be coming back!!!  Highly recommend 😊

Unfortunately, the overall experience did not meet the level of service we expected, especially considering the $199 package.  Here are the specific concerns from his visit:  1.

      We are from out of town, here in Miami for vacation. We booked the 60 min couple massage, a hydra-peel facial and reflexology. The place is clean, staff very warm and pleasant. The massage tho, boy—it was too harsh. It being our first couple massage experience we were unsure of what to expect. Knew to advocate and I did— but I must admit, in my befuddlement, I may waited 10 min too long, and damag
