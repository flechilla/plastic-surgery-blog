      Amazing experience. I just moved in near by so I stopped by unexpectedly.  I don’t encourage that for Nicole’s sanity… but she was so accommodating, was able to squeeze me in, and even helped me with getting the invoice to a third party payer.

      I just went to NuYou for some maintenance and I loved the experience. Highly recommend Nicole. She was efficient and kind and just understood my goals right away. She gave me long term recommendations for my skin, but she was not pushy at all. I am super happy with the results and will be telling all of my friends to go to her.

      Nicole did an amazing job with my under eye filler and targeted lip dissolving! She is extremely talented and has regular prices, unlike the insanely up-charged prices you see throughout Miami. Professional, talented, and great service!
