      I had a breast reduction two weeks ago with Dr. Vidal. She is an amazing surgeon! Í couldn’t be happier with the results. She did exactly what I wanted and  made me feel so secure prior to surgery. Her team is also super professional and caring. The whole process from beginning to end was just perfect. Thank you Dr. Vidal!!!

      Dr. Vidal has been a wonderful surgeon to work with. She did a beautiful job on my mommy makeover. I have been very pleased with my results and the level of care I have received at the Pure Plastic Surgery Clinic. Everyone has been so helpful, kind, encouraging, and comforting. Exceptional care in a top tier facility!
