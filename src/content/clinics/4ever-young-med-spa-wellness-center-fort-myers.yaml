      I happened to be in the area and had some downtime so I decided to get a hydrafacial. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. My aesthetician was Keaunna and she was awesome. She explained the entire process from start to finish and gave me great skin advice to follow going forward. My skin feels so clean and smooth. I would absolutely be a repeat customer if I lived in the area.

      Soon as you walk in it’s welcoming, clean and feels upscale. The front desk is helpful. I was called to appointment fast. Estella was informative and took photos for profiling my needs. I would highly recommend to see them and get all your beauty care needs taken care of! And so happy I have something close to the house!
