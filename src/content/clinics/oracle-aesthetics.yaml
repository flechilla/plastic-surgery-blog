      I had the absolute best facial experience with Diana! She makes you feel at home, she has the patience to explain every process of the experience to you, makes you laugh, she even takes your personal music request to ensure the upmost relaxation. I also booked a facial for my mother's birthday, and she gave her the royal treatment! One of the kindest people I've ever met. Diana is #1!!!
