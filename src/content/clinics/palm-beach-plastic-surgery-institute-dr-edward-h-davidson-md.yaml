      I honestly feel like I could write multiple reviews at this point. There is a reason Dr. Davidson and his team have a perfect five-star rating — and it’s absolutely deserved. Saying how incredible he is at what he does, and how exceptional his team is, feels like an understatement. He has truly turned the clock back about 10 years for me and I am not even done healing yet.  The entire team is kind

      The most fantastic experience from start to finish! The staff and Dr. Davidson were beyond friendly and helpful. Incredible bedside manner to help my daughter feel comfortable and the surgery came out perfectly, looks better than new. My daughter has restored confidence in the appearance of her ears now. Could not recommend this entire practice more. I have been to many doctors offices/practices i
