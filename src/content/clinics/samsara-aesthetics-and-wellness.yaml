      Maureen, the therapist was super cool. She worked out the knots under the shoulder blades and the kink in my neck.  I walked out of there so relaxed.**** Also the hydro facial was much needed. Thank you, Michelle! Made it a spa day!! It was much needed.

      I had an amazing experience with Andrea for my laser hair removal! The clinic was spotless, and beautiful the staff were knowledgeable, and the treatment was comfortable no pain. Highly recommend to anyone considering laser — truly worth it!

      I came in as a walk-in and was helped right away. All of my questions were answered, and everyone was so kind and informative. I got a HydraFacial from (I believe) Michelle, and I absolutely loved it — highly recommend. Kylie at the front desk was also super sweet and welcoming.
