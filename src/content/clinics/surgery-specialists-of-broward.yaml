      Once again, Dr. Weinstein and staff are being recognized for their assistance in getting my surgery performed.  Patty, the surgical coordinator, was extremely helpful in the expediting and scheduling of my surgery! And of course,  Dr. Weinstein, who has seen me more than 5 times for surgery, completed another without any major problems.  Would highly recommend for any services you need to be handl

      Dr Weinstein is Amazing. He has now done two surgeries on me, removing cyst and mass from my breasts.  He made sure to explain everything to me and walk me through options.   The surgery was smooth little to no pain and healing amazingly.  The incision line is small and when healed will barely even notice it. Very talented and knowledgeable Dr.

      From the first time I walked into the Dr. Office I felt the warmth and comfort you look for when seeking new medical advice. The entire staff from the receptionist to the Dr. Wienstien  was a great experience. I would recommend this office if you are seeking a caring professional practice.

      Dr. Weinstein and the staff at his office were great!  I was going thru a very stressful time, and had to have a minor surgery (excisional biopsy), but it was my first time to have surgery in my 47 years.  Everyone I dealt with was easy going and helpful.  Dr. Weinstein was patient to listen and answer all my questions.   I was coming off of a bad experience with another health care provider havin
