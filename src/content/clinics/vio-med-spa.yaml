      Hi I recently wrote a review that wasn’t so favorable. Sorry about that just needed to tell my experience. However since then I have been contacted by the staff with some questions. They were extremely apologetic & I appreciate that. They actually cared enough to reach out to make things right and apologize. Like I said before,  I know that one person doesn’t make up the whole company. The place w

      had my first appointment with Yagmary at VO Med Spa in September and I cannot say enough great things about her. She instantly put me at ease, explained everything so clearly, and made the whole experience feel comfortable and personalized. I’m actually looking forward to my next appointment—she’s that good! So grateful I found her.

      I had an excellent experience at VIO. It was my first time visiting and the staff went above and beyond to make it great. Jacquie was super helpful and made the entire process easy! Yagmary did a great job. She took the time to answer any questions and made sure I was comfortable the entire time. I left with a great result, wonderful experience, and without feeling rushed. Loyal VIO customer now!

      I had such a wonderful experience at VIO Med Spa in Palm Beach Gardens! The staff was so welcoming and made me feel completely comfortable from the moment I walked in. I booked a hydrafacial, and my skin has never looked or felt better—fresh, glowing, and hydrated. The provider explained every step of the process and really customized the treatment to my skin’s needs. The spa itself is spotless an
