      I love this place!! I have been here for about 8 months now and it has been amazing!! My laser appointments have been so good! Minnie is amazing, so great and explains everything. My hair is basically gone (I never thought this was possible!) The staff is amazing!! Also my facial with Maddie was so relaxing! She is so sweet and is constantly checking up on you and making sure that you feel good! I

      3 time at aesthetic vibes med spa and as always it is a delight. This is my second seasonal facial, the first one being the alpine facial and the second the sweethearts facials. Maddy as always treats my skin with delicacy and precision. The spa and the staff is incredible and I always feel so welcomed. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a new med spa 🤍

They’ve also been helping me with small facial hair thr

The service exceeded my expectations — everything was clearly explained, and the procedure was performed with
