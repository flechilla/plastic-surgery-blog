      I had the best experience ever!!!!! First time doing Laser, and everyone at the office was very hospitable and friendly. Alicia is the NP that did my laser and she’s truly an amazing at what she does. She made sure I was educated prior to performing the laser and was very patient and thorough the whole process. I loved every minute and immediately signed up for more sessions.
