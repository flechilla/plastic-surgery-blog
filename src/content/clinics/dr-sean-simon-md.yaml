      Having my breast reduction with Dr. Simon was the best decision I’ve ever made for myself. Choosing him and his team was absolutely the right choice. Dr. Simon is amazing and extremely attentive to his work. I am loving my results so far and feel so confident showing them off.  The office and surgical staff are just as wonderful. Every time I go into the office, Andrea, Alicia, and the entire team

      I had an absolutely amazing experience with Dr. Simon and his entire team. From start to finish, everyone in the office was so kind, professional, and genuinely caring. I underwent a breast augmentation and a tummy tuck, and I could not be happier with my results. Dr. Simon made me feel completely comfortable, explained every step of the process, and delivered beautiful, natural-looking outcomes.
