      Do not sign up for more info. They will harass you from 7 different phone numbers because apparently to them when you say STOP, they’ll just keep going from another number. Most recently I got this unprofessional gem from them! Get it together, you’re supposed to be a medical office???

      The Goals Miami team is incredible. The doctors are legends, Dr. Pittman and Dr. V. The staff, Alex and Emmanuella made sure I felt comfortable from beginning to end. Even the massage therapist was so nice and caring. If you’re going to have a procedure or want to start the process I would highly recommend Goals Miami. They are honest and want you to have the outcomes you desire. 5 stars!

      It was a pleasure doing business with this GPS location.  Did my research and am pleased with my results and progress.  The staff on the phone was most patient and informative.  Unfortunately, they are limited as I needed further assistance with two separate matters.  Dr. Pittman is the best!  The staff onsite treated me like family from day one.  Irania and Aileen are most patient, knowledgeable,
