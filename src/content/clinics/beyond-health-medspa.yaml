      After a long search, I decided to go to Beyond because, in my opinion, Dr. Lillian seemed professional and trustworthy. I must say I was not mistaken. The process was easy, and I’ve already begun to see results, although depending on the procedure, it may take months for them to become fully visible.

      My experience was unacceptable and unprofessional behavior from the person handling instagran before even my appointment day scheduled for Feb 13 at 2pm, today on intagram I asked are the results permanent?

      Great experience at Beyond Health Medspa. I came in for IV therapy and everything was smooth from start to finish. The staff was professional, knowledgeable, and made me feel comfortable the entire time. The space was clean and relaxing, and they explained the process clearly. I felt refreshed afterward and will definitely be coming back. Highly recommend.

      For YEARS, I’ve been struggling with acne issues, trying countless products and treatments with little to no success. From the very first visit, Dr. Lillian made me feel heard and understood. She took the time to really assess my skin, explain what was going on, and create a treatment plan that actually worked for me. Thanks to her expertise, patience, and genuine care, my skin has improved so muc
