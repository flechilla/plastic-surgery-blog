      It was my first time coming here, the staff is very professional. Makes sure to make you feel comfortable and confident. I loved how my lips looked after the treatment. Mildred is amazing at what she does and makes sure you are okay every step of the way. I appreciated how the product and process was explained and shown to me, made me feel included on what was going on. Amazing office and job.

      Amazing experience. The staff is super friendly, very knowledgeable of their products, they took great care of me and took the time to understand what I was looking for and gave me some perspective on my skin goals. Love the results, noticed a huge difference on my skin after the very first procedure, I also tried out several of their products and fell in love with their personal skincare line. 10
