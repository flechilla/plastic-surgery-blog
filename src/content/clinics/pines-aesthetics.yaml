      This is my second time getting a facial treatment with Stephanie, and once again she exceeded my expectations. She is absolutely amazing — extremely gentle, caring, and very professional. From the moment you walk in, she makes you feel comfortable and explains everything in detail, which I truly appreciate. I have tried other aesthetics places before, and I can honestly say this has been the best

      I had the VelaShape with Brittany and was so happy with the results. She recommended next the Venus legacy which I plan on coming back for. She’s incredibly sweet, friendly, and took her time to explain everything. She made me feel very comfortable. Also the girls in the front are super nice and very welcoming. I love this place! Great experience overall!” Highly recommend!”

      Stephanie is absolutely amazing at lips. She is meticulous, gentle, and truly has an eye for natural, beautiful results. I felt completely comfortable and trusted her every step of the way. My lips look incredible, and I honestly won’t go to anyone else. If you’re considering lip treatments, Stephanie is the one ! Not to mention the staff, including Emily treat you like VIP :)

      From the moment I walked in, I felt completely at ease. The staff is so welcoming. I chose this clinic based on their great reviews, and they exceeded all expectations. My injector, Stephanie, was meticulous, funny, and sweet. She listened to my concerns and made me feel so comfortable. The injections were quick and had minimal discomfort.  Within a week, the results kicked in, and I was in awe. M
