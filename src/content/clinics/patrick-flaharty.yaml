      I went to Dr. Patrick Flaharty at Azul for a face and neck lift hoping I would look 10 years younger after the surgery.  I am 73 years old but I now look much younger than 63.  People tell me I look like I am in my middle forties. Unbelievable!  I can not say enough about the wonderful experience I have had with Dr. Flaharty and his entire team.

      My first trip to Azul, but the office was very friendly and efficient.    Only part of the process takes place in the office where I met with Dr Flaherty .   If I proceed with my treatment they were very good at explaining the process ie; time frame, places where the appt would be and what each step entails.

      He was very forthcoming with what was going to happen before during and after surgery. I expected some discomfort and brusing and extra time off, but it was not that bad. Very little bruising, pain had to be careful with squenching my eyes. No time off. Tylenol took care of pain.

      Happy to say it is always a 5 star experience. I would not consider going anywhere else. Not only are the results always excellent. I consider the whole staff my friends.
