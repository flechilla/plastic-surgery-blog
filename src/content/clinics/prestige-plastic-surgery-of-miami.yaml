Vanessa at the front desk was so sweet and comforting throughout the process.  They truly love what they do. I’ve been wan

      I went for a breast reduction surgery as the girls no longer look as good as they used to Before having kids. No implants just size reduction and lift . I wanted to do something for my self so I decided to go  from a H cup to D / C  cup. I also had Dr De Leon take out the auxiliary tissues under my arms which have been my biggest insecurities. I woke up to a better shaped back, no more back rolls

Dr. Deleon also prescribes great medications and they’re not expensive at all for the am

      I am currently six days post-op from my breast augmentation, and I could not be happier with my experience with Dr. DeLeon. Her bedside manner made me feel comfortable, informed, and genuinely cared for. She took the time to answer all my questions thoroughly and made sure I felt confident going into surgery and was so kind to my mother who was anxiously accompanying me.  I am very excited with my
