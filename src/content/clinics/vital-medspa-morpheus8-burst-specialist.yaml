      Jose is extremely knowledgeable and amazing to work with. He helped guide both myself and my husband on our new peptide protocol. I love that he follows the science and research, and gives his best recommendation based on your personal goals, his wealth of comprehension, and what the science has uncovered. 11/10 highly recommend Jose and vital med spa! Thank you, Jose!

Jose is insanely talented and really
