      Love coming here!!! I’ve been coming to this med spa  for a year and a half for lip augmentation and I highly recommend it! The owner is amazing and the doctor that does my lips always exceeds my expectations. So happy with how they come out every single time. They also make you feel so comfortable, literally the only place I will ever go to for lips!
