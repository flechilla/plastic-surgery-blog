      Leaving a review is the least I can do to thank the group of beautiful, amazing, and caring women that I met in my experience here. I want to thank the Galina, her beautiful daughter Karde, and most importantly, Mary, who facilitated my Babor collagen facial. Not only did Mary educate me and inform me on my sensitive skin type and rosacea, she made the experience incredibly enjoyable and relaxing.

My skin feels amazing - so soft and glowing 😍🤩✨ Mary explained everything she was doing. The Spa has such a relaxing vibe too. If you’re thinking about getting a hydrafacial, I totally recommend checking them out. Already planning my next visit :) thankssss !

      I absolutely love this place! The staff is always friendly and welcoming, and Galina (the owner) makes every visit such a pleasant experience — she’s warm, attentive, and truly cares about her clients. I’ve had several treatments here, and every one of them has gone perfectly. The results are great, the atmosphere is relaxing, and the pricing is just right. Highly recommend!

      It’s my second micro needling session with Galina and I am extremely happy. I saw a massive improvement with my pores being significantly smaller after the first session. Today, a month later, we did the second session and we included my neck and I can’t wait to share the results. Also the spa is so nice, beautiful and comfy. Yazmin the assistant is also super sweet. Highly recommended 🫶🏻
