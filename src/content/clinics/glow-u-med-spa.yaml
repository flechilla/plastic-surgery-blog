      Christina at Glow U Med Spa is amazing. She did my lip filler and I’m obsessed with how natural and beautiful they look. She really listened and made me feel so comfortable the entire time.

      I always have a great experience at GlowU Med Spa. The Hydrafacial was incredible and the Botox was done beautifully. Jenn, Starr, and Christina are so kind and caring, and the vibe is always on point. It’s my go-to med spa.

      I live in Miami and still drive to Boca because the service and trust here are worth it. The team is professional, knowledgeable, and truly cares about their clients results. I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Jennifer at the front desk is amazing, welcoming, stunning, and always makes the experience even better. Such a great place all around! Go check them out!!

      I got a hydrofacial with Star recently and noticed immediately after my face was so smooth and hydrated. It didnt dissapear once i washed my face and removed the products either. She explained each product she used and asked me personal questions to assure the facial was perfect!! We did combo red/blue UV to help and it was all good. 100% Recommend to come here! The spa itself is so nice and moder
