      Went for a daxxify special for Valentine's day and the result is so good! They put numbing ointment on so you don't feel anything, and it was quick and painless. This stuff started working in like three days! I love it!

      I have been referred to Dr. Spera's office. I have seen his work on my friend. He is Excellent Doctor.  However, I do  not know if he has an answering service. A woman answered and she automatically referred me to an office that was far from me, without even letting me speak. She sounded like a tape recorder. I had to explain one area of Miami, is not Hialeah. I highly suggest they get more custom

I am an MD as well. I went to his office in Hialeah and showed pictures
