      I just had awake lipo on my chin 3 days ago and my experience has been incredible. I knew right after the procedure that my neck was going to look snatched. I can’t wait to see the fully healed results but I’m loving it so far. The whole team is incredibly nice and I couldn’t rate them higher. If you’re thinking about getting chin lipo, just do it! I wish I would have done it sooner.

      Do Not go to this Place! Botched Lipo! Dr. Gisele is NOT a Certified Palstic Sergon but charges like she is. I wish I would have read the reviews before I went to get Botched!

Do Your Homework. All her grea

I am on week 3 and so happy with the results even thoug

      I had Lipo done on my legs here after being diagnosed with lipedema. First I would love to thank the team, from scheduling assistance, the girls being active on the texting system/front desk, and Dr Giselle who is so kind and knowledgeable. My day of surgery went so smooth and I had a nurse talking to me the entire time, which was so sweet as I was anxious! This was my first awake surgery ever as

      Just had a tummy tuck with lipo, and I can't say enough good things about Dr. Kim and her team. Everyone has been so welcoming and engaging.  Always ready to answer questions.  Never felt pressured or overwhelmed.  Planning on a second procedure and probably services in the future. Highly recommend! 😁  Update: Had 2nd procedure, breast lift with implants two weeks ago. Another fantastic experienc
