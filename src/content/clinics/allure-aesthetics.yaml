      I went to Allure to get Botox done by Izzy this past week. I've only done botox once before and it was a while ago. Izzy made me feel super comfortable and was able to consult me on the best options. The office is very welcoming and well put together. I'll be back!!

      I had the best experience getting Botox with Izzy! She’s a PA and truly the absolute best, so educational, gentle, and knowledgeable. She explained everything clearly, made me feel completely comfortable, and the results look amazing and natural. I couldn’t be happier!! If you’re considering going to Allure, go see Izzy!
