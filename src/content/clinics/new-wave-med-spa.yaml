      If I could give them -10 stars, I would.  I started my laser hair removal journey with New Wave Med Spa in 2024 at their original Miami location near 27th Ave. I chose them because they were only 6 minutes from my home, had decent reviews, and offered competitive pricing. My mom and I purchased packages for laser hair removal and Venus Legacy sessions there.  Not long after, they claimed a “pipe b

I did get their $50 IPL laser (bought a package of 3 of those!)  and I’ll be back for more services soon!! So

      I made an appointment for 12:00 PM after specifically asking how long the procedure would take and making it clear I had to leave by 2:30 PM. They told me it would take two hours—fine. I arrived early at 11:53 AM, filled out the form immediately, and was literally the only client there. Then I was told the nurse was running 15 minutes late. Annoying, but I was still willing to wait.  Fifteen minut

      I had an amazing experience at this luxury spa! The facial left my skin glowing and hydrated, and the esthetician was so attentive to my needs. Even the hair removal was quick and gentle, with great results. The atmosphere was serene, and I felt completely pampered. Can’t wait to go back!
