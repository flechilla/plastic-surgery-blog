      I have seen Dr R on several occasions -- all involving skin cancer issues. One case was particularly involved (he basically replaced a large part of the left side of my face) and the result has been truly remarkable. I highly recommend Dr R and his practice.

Now have to save up for another breast augmentation. After a year and half I have to still ice my right boob from the pain it causes me. Thanks dr.
