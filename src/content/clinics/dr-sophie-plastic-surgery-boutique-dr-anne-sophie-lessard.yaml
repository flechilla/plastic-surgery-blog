      I am here to give Dr Lessard my most enthusiastic recommendation.   Four Weeks ago I had a Breast Explant, Replant, Breast Lift and Back flank lipo performed by Dr. Lessard.  I am also married to a surgeon therefore I am cognizant of what constitutes a great result.  Dr Lessard is professional while patient.  She listens to what you want and is honest about your results.  The entire process, from
