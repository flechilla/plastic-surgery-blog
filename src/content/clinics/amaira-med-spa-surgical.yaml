      I went to Wendi at Amaira with lips that I was unhappy about and she did not disappoint!! She was so kind, comforting and knowledgeable about everything. I left feeling so happy and my lips looked amazing! The staff was all very accommodating and they truly care about your results. Highly recommend!
