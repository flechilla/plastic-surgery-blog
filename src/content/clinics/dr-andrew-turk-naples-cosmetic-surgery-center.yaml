      My experience with Dr. Turk and his staff has been exceptional. Cindy is always so welcoming that it's like visiting family instead of a doctor's office.

I've been so impressed that I am going to have another procedu

      I had my neck done in January. Now 6 months down the road, people I haven't seen in a few months have exclaimed "You look terrific!" And I agree with them.  Dr. Turk did a great job! The entire staff is welcoming and professional, and quickly responded to any questions I had.

      8 weeks post surgery and already seeing excellent results. I shopped around a bit, and I chose Dr Turk because he was kind and calm and I felt comfortable with his manner. Scheduling was easy too. First I had a Fraxel laser done then 2 months later I had an upper and lower bleph and an extended necklift. I had originally asked about a brow lift and Dr T felt it wasn't necessary, so happy with that
