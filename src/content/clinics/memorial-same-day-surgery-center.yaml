      Excellent service. The surgery was performed exactly as scheduled, on time, and with professional care from all members of the surgical team, as well as wonderful nurses and anesthesiologists. Special recognition for the outstanding work of the surgeon and the wonderful nurse Nadia. Very satisfied with the service and care overall.
