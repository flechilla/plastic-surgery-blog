      The esthetician in Ft. Lauderdale, Kennedi, is amazing! She has done my microneedling RF and laser treatments. She is so knowledgable and professional and also makes every treatment tailored to whatever your skin concerns are. She is the sweetest and we have the best time anytime I go see her! Highly rec for any skincare needs in the Ft. Lauderdale area!
