      ⭐ 1 STAR — If I could give zero, I would.  Fran’s Eyecare is the definition of an eye-factory with zero personal touch and absolutely no real solutions. My husband went in simply needing one lens for one eye. Instead of offering actual care, they slapped a contact in, sent him home for the weekend with no extras, no backup, no guidance — nothing.  Surprise, surprise… it got stuck in his eye.  He s

      I had a wonderful experience with Dr Frantz's team. From the front staff to the back office, everyone is very kind. I was seen by Dr Hogan, and she and Lessie were wonderful and very thorough. I am a disabled veteran and I have to use a Cain and it was very easy to get around. Thank all of you at Dr. Frantz for making my visit such a pleasant experience.
