      Great doctor. Listens to everything you have to say. Answers any questions you may have. Did a successful surgery for my little 4m old (now 5 m) on her jaw. The staff is also very sweet. Very inviting.

      Dr. Kamel & his PA, and all the staff were fantastic. From our consultation to the surgery to our follow up appt. They made the whole process seamless and easy for our 8 year old daughter that needed an ear lobe repair. Can’t say enough good things. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a pediatric plastic surgeon.
