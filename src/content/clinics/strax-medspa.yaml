      A MedSpa built on integrity and the long standing traditions and expertise of the Strax team. Where similar businesses take a "pop-up" approach; Strax MedSpa treats you like family and has been for well over 20 years. Keep up the amazing work and thanks for all that you do.

My family members are so impressed by the work and my sister has decided to visit the facility for a consultation.

To make matters worse, Tammy refused to refund me, even though I was charged

      I had the most spectacular experience at this Strax Rejuvenation! It started with a phone call from Javier, who guided me through the process and connected me with the perfect surgeon for my procedure. He was incredibly knowledgeable and put me at ease. Then, I met Isabel, who welcomed me with her beautiful smile and made me feel so comfortable. She provided an exceptional experience throughout my
