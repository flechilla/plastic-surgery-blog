      Amazing experience at ARVIV Medical Aesthetics! Nicole did my Botox and I couldn’t be happier with the results. She was professional, knowledgeable, and made me feel completely comfortable. Highly recommend!

      I’ve been coming to Arviv Medical Aesthetics for my Botox treatments and the experience is always amazing. The team is professional, attentive, and truly takes the time to understand what you’re looking for.

      I had breast augmentation scars treated here with 6 procedures over 8 months (CO2 laser, 3 IPLs, PICO, microneedling, multiple Kenalog injections). Total cost: ~$4,000.
