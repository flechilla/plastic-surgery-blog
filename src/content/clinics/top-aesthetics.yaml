      In June of 2025, I had a breast lift with silicone implants placed dual plane under the muscle, along with a GalaFlex internal mesh bra, performed by Dr. Humberto Palladino at Top Aesthetics — and I couldn’t be happier with the entire experience! 💕  After losing 65 pounds, I wanted to restore my breasts to their former glory — and Dr. Palladino delivered exactly what I had envisioned and more. 🙌

      I had an amazing experience at Top Aesthetics, and I can’t say enough great things about the team. Dr. Nasseri was absolutely on point during my surgery—professional, skilled, and truly reassuring every step of the way. I felt confident and well taken care of throughout the entire process.

      I can’t thank Dr. Palladino and his amazing team enough! From the very beginning, they treated me with so much kindness and care. I was honestly scared before surgery, but they made me feel completely safe and confident. The entire experience , from surgery to recovery was better than I could have imagined. Everyone was so attentive and made sure I was comfortable every step of the way. Dr. Pallad
