      This place is fantastic. I had a facial from Connie who went above and beyond. She explained my skin type and suggested specific products for me to purchase and use in my daily life. I can tell that she does her research and I appreciated her level of care. My massage was also wonderful and the receptionist was super helpful with scheduling as they are very busy! I highly recommend!

      I had such a great experience at New Life Health. The staff was very nice and they offer such a variety of treatments. I got my lashes done and Amanda did an amazing job, I am so pleased with the results. I will definitely come back. :)
