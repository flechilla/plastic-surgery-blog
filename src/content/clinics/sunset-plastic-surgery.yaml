      Such a wonderful experience from start to finish. Scheduling, quoting, and communication is done through an app so you have everything in one place for reference. Nora is super sweet while she helps you get all set up.  Pre-op instruction is clear and easy to understand, just really try to start the process with your own primary care provider as soon as you can, so you can get all your tests done

      I can’t say enough good things about my experience at Sunset Plastic Surgery with Dr. Ziyad Hammoudeh.

He combined a strong work ethic with genuine compassion, which made me feel confident and safe th

      I am not sure where to start. Dr Z is an amazing surgeon. My results are amazing and so has everyone else's I've seen. What i don't like is that it feels like a glorified upscaie Chop Shop. People pay a lot of money to get surgery however the post op and preop takes forever and it sucks. The office is not decorated, its plain, no scale in the rooms. He doesn't even take your vitals! You could lite

      Dr. Ziyad is an exceptional expert in his field and an outstanding surgeon. His tummy tucks are unparalleled. I have recommended at least six women from various parts of the United States to him, all of whom have experienced remarkable outcomes and have shared their transformative journeys. Additionally, he is supported by an excellent team; his anesthesiologist was remarkable and ensured I felt c
