      I had such a great experience at La Belle Vie Aesthetics! I saw Chris for Dysport—it was my first time ever so I was nervous! He explained everything clearly, answered all my questions, provided education and shared great aftercare tips. He put me at ease & the results look amazing. Definitely excited to keep coming back. I also had an amazing facial with Kate—also a first for me & she met me with

      First time getting any type of botox and Chris was professional, straight forward, and made me feel very comfortable. My results were amazing and did not feel overdone. I brought my mother a week later and she has nothing but positive things to say about Chris!

      I booked the same day, because I usually work but got the day off! Kate was amazing, and talked me through every step! I have acne, so I thought dermaplaning would help me! My skin was glowing after, and it was the most relaxing hour! I plan on coming back, and couldn't recommend her enough!
