      Such an amazing MedSpa! As soon as you enter the lobby, you can tell that it’s going to be a high-quality, luxurious experience. Dr.Tal explained that the procedure very well and kept checking in with me to make sure I was tolerating the laser treatment well. Truly such a great experience and can’t wait to be back! I’d recommend anyone!

I told her I would return after doing a bit of research, and as promised, I went back and began my pigmentation treat
