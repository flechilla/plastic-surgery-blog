      My experience with Dr.Nir was amazing. I got a breast augmentation September 2025 and got exactly what I was wanting. I went from a very small B to a full size C. They are so natural and feel like they’ve been my boobs since forever. The staff and Dr.Nir made me very comfortable since day one especially surgery day. I was very nervous for it being my first time going under but his girls did amazin

      I cannot recommend Dr. Nir enough! From the first phone call to make an appointment to my first consultation to the decision, I knew I was in expert hands. Choosing a plastic surgeon is a huge decision, but Dr. Nir and the team made me feel completely at ease.

      I found Dr. Nir from his incredible reviews and I’m so glad I did. I had a surgery scheduled w someone else but the week leading up to it was chaotic and there was a lot of miscommunication and misdirection with the previous doctor. I reluctantly canceled my surgery and started to search for other doctors. I dug through everyone from Miami to Naples and that’s when I found Dr. Nir.  He is incredib

      STAY CLEAR OF DR. ITZHAK NIR  Doctor Itzhak Nir stole approximately $4,000 from me. He sees his patients as dollar signs not as humans. He didn’t do a thorough pre op and check my heart rate before surgery ( he was too focused on trying to upsell me instead of doing a thorough pre op).So the day of surgery comes and he discovers I have an irregular heartbeat and won’t do surgery and won’t give my
