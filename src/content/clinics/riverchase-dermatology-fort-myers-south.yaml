      I see Dr. Durando.  She is easy to talk to, takes her time to explain things.  She and her staff are great.  I never have to wait long.  If my appointment is 3 pm, then I am called back to see doctor shortly thereafter. The office is very good at reminding patients about appointments. I can check in at home which also saves time.   The doctor and staff make it as stress free as possible.

They checked me in and got me in early. The doctor was very informative and explained everything to me taking his time to make sure that I understood what was going on and what was going to happen. I was very pleased with my visit and wil
