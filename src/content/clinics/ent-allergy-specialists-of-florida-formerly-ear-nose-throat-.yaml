      Dr Kopp combines exceptional knowledge with a warm, friendly, effervescent personality. I felt so very comfortable with him from the moment he said hi with such positive energy! The staff at ENT & Allergy Specialists exhibits the same positive, warm feelings making me as a patient feel comfortable. I also want to give a huge thank you to ENT & Allergy Specialists staff for successfully fighting on

      Just love all aspects of this practice!  Friendly reception and check in with a smile, minimal wait time, prompt CAT scan and Dr. Kopp is knowledgeable and helpful. I trust the diagnosis and I am so happy I changed Doctors.  I feel welcome with all the team members and found the best group for ENT Specialists!

      I had been suffering for months going to a doctor who dismissed the severity of my condition and sent me here when he realized I was too severe for him to treat. I was immediately referred to surgery, and I was well informed of the process and all the risks. Dr. Casey is kind and thorough.

      After I signed in, I waited a very long time while newer arrivals were called back. I finally spoke to the receptionist who asked if she checked me in, to which I replied "no". So she checks me in and I wait about another 10 minutes before going in the exam room. Exam was fine, but I wasn't happy to learn the overpayment from my last visit couldn't be handled at the office as the practice is under

Life by itself gets in the way.. progress is being made on what is trying to get accomplished... hope this is of some help.  I recommend ENT  Specialists ...when asked
