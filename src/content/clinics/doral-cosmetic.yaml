      GOOD LUCK trying to get an appointment.  I have called, emailed, and when that didn't work (with no return call of course) I booked on their website.  I showed up yesterday for my appointment, and the door's locked.  I called to let them know I was there, and of course no answer.  BEYOND ridiculous (and I hate leaving bad reviews)..but you've been warned.  Go find somewhere else, that you don't ha

      I came to this beautiful location with high hopes based on these amazing reviews and I am so glad I did! I had weight loss injections and laser which was done extremely professionally and efficiently. Doral cosmetics has helped me achieve my dream body and I’m beyond happy with their services! Will be recommending to all my friends.

      I came to Doral Cosmetic, to have done the Dysport treatment Amazing service and lovely people, they make you feel very welcomed. Even though this was not my first time having this treatment it was the first time having this treatment at this location,  and the Doctor took her time explaining all the procedure. I will definitely be back. I recommend them.
