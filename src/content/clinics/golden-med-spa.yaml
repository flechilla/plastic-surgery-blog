      I got the multivitamin IV and i would go back again. I work two jobs and they're very demanding  both physically/mentally. After my appointment my body as a whole felt completely rejuvenated, no fatigue, no joint or muscle aches, my focus and clarity was sharp. I will make plans to visit once every two months as a maintenance.
