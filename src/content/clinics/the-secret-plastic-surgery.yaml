Now to the surgery center....They are very very very disorganized and no one speaks a lick of English. This is very hard when going into surgery and the communication seems off.

My coordinator Aylin has been an exceptional source of

      I had my Breast Lift with Gel implants done in The Secret 3 weeks ago and I want to say that I am loving my results, my doctor is Dr. Valina and she is amazing, she is very attentive, always explaining everything and making sure you are understanding. Since the beginning I was treated very well by my coordinator Gretel, she is so nice and helpful, she always answered my questions right the way and
