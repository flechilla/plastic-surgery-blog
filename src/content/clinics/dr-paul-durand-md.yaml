      I had a face lift and Blephoplasty and it made me look a decade younger. I had it 5/25 and 8 months later I am near completely healed. Dr Durand is an expert. No need to feel anxious you’re in the best of hands. I have much appreciation and zero regrets! A big thank you Doctor Durand❣️

My face looks very natural and smooth and you cannot see any scars . I did follow all the post surgery instructions . The staff is also very professional and caring . Everyone that knows me says there’s a huge difference and my face looks younger and refreshed without look

      Hands down best plastic surgeon. Dr. Durand is a professional and very detailed. He answered my 100 questions and made me feel comfortable and ready for my surgery. I had a tummy tuck, lipo of my flanks and hernia repair. It's only been 7 weeks and the results are remarkable, I'm excited to see the final results after the inflammation is 100% gone. I have two kids and both were c-sections and my a
