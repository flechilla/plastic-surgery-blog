      Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Theiss and the entire staff were excellent from start to finish. Very thorough explained the Procedure prior to beginning and made sure that I was comfortable. I was in and out in 40 mins,, but never felt rushed.  The follow up Visit went smoothly and I was given excellent  news. Gave me follow up directions and asked if I had any questions.  Truly, five star service.

      Dr. Shapiro and team were awesome! Had to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed, 2 of them impacted. In and out in about 2 hours with clear instructions on days to come. Had basically no swelling after 24 hrs and doc even texted me the night of the surgery to check in. Quick and easy recovery. Highly recommend
