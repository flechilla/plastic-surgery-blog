The staff here has been super amazing, these girls are the best by the way! They will always make you feel at home and super special. I recommend Dolls plastic surgery

      I got my breast augmentation done with Dr. Berman, I’m beyond happy with everything! From the second I walked in, the front desk girls were super sweet and made me feel do comfortable . The doctor  was amazing, made sure I was totally ok, and just really knew his stuff. The whole experience was pretty good, and the attention was top-notch. It’s been two months, and they still check in on me. Highl
