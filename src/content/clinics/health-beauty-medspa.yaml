      I called to confirm my appointment but no one answered the phone. I arrived 20mins prior to my appointment and there was no one to help me until I called someone. I was in a time crunch but didn’t get seen until late into my appointment. I waited for an hour and had to leave. I couldn’t reschedule because once again… there was no one to assist me.

      Today I had a procedure with Dr. Cibrian, it was excellent, she was very professional, she explained everything to me, step by step, even though it was a little bit uncomfortable at the beginning but everything went great, she and her assistant were very nice, I would recommend to anybody this health and beauty spa, they would explain to you which procedure is perfect to you according to your need
