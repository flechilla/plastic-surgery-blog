I stayed at the hotel with the aftercare center and couldn’t have asked for more compassionate, thorough treatment. The nurses and staff were wonderful!!

I was in the hands of the BEST PLASTIC SURGEON in the UNIVERSE.  I booked my appointment in December of 2018  with Ari, she was so sweet and answer

      My surgery was on 6/5/18! Dr. Miami and his staff all are amazing. They really love what they do and make you feel at home in their office, which is very important for patients traveling out of state.
