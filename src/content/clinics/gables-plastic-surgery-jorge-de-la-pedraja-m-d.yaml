      Dr. de la Pedraja and his staff deserve more than 5 stars. I couldn't be happier with my results and his care. He is knowledgeable and professional but at the same time caring and patient.  I never felt rushed - both Dr and staff answered all my questions and addressed any concerns. They are wonderful.
