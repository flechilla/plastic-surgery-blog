      I went to Bespoke Aesthetics to inquire about Sofwave, a procedure that tightens your skin and encourages collagen production.

      Christina is amazing.  I love how she know exactly what I need and when to do it.  Last night I had a BBL/ Moxie laser and she was gentle and trustworthy with every step. I can't wait to see the results . She is young and knows all the right procedures and is so knowledgeable!   I have been going to Bespoke for a while now and I love love love all the girls there (especially Cass) and Christina is
