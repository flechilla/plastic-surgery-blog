      Good morning I have been waiting on a call back from you the whole month. Can you give me a call back please? It's very important if I don't talk to someone soon I'm gonna miss my surgery date and I don't wanna do that. I’m starting to think it’s a scam! I’m having the same problems as these ppl in these reviews.

      Had my breast augmentation surgery back in January this year and I cannot explain how wonderful my experience was at this center with its team. Excellent service to patients and Elena (the surgical manager) offers an outstanding attention alongside her team. I would definitely recommend this center that made me, during this whole process, feel like home :)

      I had a Breast lift, an etching, and BBL combo at Design plastic surgery. It’s only been a few days but I’m in love with my results!! I’m still a little swollen from the liposuction but my faja is giving me good compression and I already look super snatched. My breast came out beautiful, nice and perky, a full C just the way I wanted them. The whole team is great. They have excellent customer serv
