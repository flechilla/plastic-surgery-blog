      Leah is one of the most talented practitioners I’ve ever worked with. I trust her implicitly with lasers and injectables. She’s truly the best.

      I had a halo/bbl laser treatment and injectables with Leah and a hydra facial with Bev.  The results are amazing.  Leah and Bev are both outstanding to work with.  They both care greatly for their patients and are a pleasure to deal with.  Highly recommend!

      From my first consultation with Leah Verdream to the day when the treatment was done, she has been very knowledgeable & professional.  She recommended exactly what I needed and I LOVE the result. She is amazing and took really good care of me. I will give Lickstein Plastic Surgery more than 5 stars if I could. The entire team is amazing. I’m very happy with my results.
