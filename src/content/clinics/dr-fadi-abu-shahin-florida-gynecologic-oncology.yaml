      Dr. Abu Shahin is an excellent professional. I had surgery two months ago and from our first visit I felt safe, informed and well taken care of. The whole process was successful and everything went smoothly. He is amazing. Highly recommend.

      Dr. Abu Shahin is an extremely caring physician/surgeon. He made me comfortable the minute I met him and he made sure any questions I had were answered. I was frightened about my surgery and he put me at ease. His staff is well trained and also have his professional manner. Everything involved with my care and surgery went smoothly.
