      Amazing experience!! Dr. Harrell made me feel comfortable and at ease with my entire procedure from beginning to end. He is very knowledgeable and takes his time explaining all the details about the procedure. I never once felt rushed. Thank you Dr. Harrell and Haizel for a wonderful experience and not to mention amazing results!!
