      Nicole is an absolute professional. She patient and very through. She took the time to go through my medical history, my skincare routine (or lack thereof) and what we are going to do to reverse the sun damage and work towards health, hydrated and radiant skin! After my treatment I could see a marked improvement and I look forward to my continued treatment! I highly recommend BareFace Aesthetics!

      I’ve known Nicole for almost two years now, and I can already tell it’s going to be a lifelong connection. Bareface Aesthetics has become a place where I feel truly comfortable and safe in my skin.  As a guy, it can be a bit intimidating figuring out how to approach self care and skincare. But Nicole makes you feel right at home. You can show up as your authentic self, and she’ll make sure you lea

      I have been seeing Nicole for 1 year now, trust and believe me when I say she is the best esthetician out there, especially for those struggling with acne. I have dealt with acne for 10 years, and I tried everything except for medication, but nothing would make it go away. I hated looking in the mirror; I was so insecure with the amount of redness and scarring from acne over the years. I was ready
