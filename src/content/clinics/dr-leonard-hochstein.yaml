      I had my surgery with Dr. Hochstein two years ago, and before I even went through with it, my biggest concern was how I would emotionally deal with my surgical scar afterward. It was something I worried about constantly.  Working with Liana for inkless scar needling at Hochstein MedSpa completely changed that for me.  I just had my second inkless needling session with Liana yesterday, and after se

I especially want

      ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 12/10 Experience!  I had a breast lift with Dr. Hochstein, and I honestly couldn’t be happier with my experience. From the very first consultation to my post-op care, he was incredibly attentive, patient, and thorough. He took the time to answer all of my questions and made sure I felt comfortable every step of the way.  His entire team is just as amazing — Amanda and Jennifer were alwa

      I had surgery with Dr. Hochstein three months ago, and without a doubt, it has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life. The level of care was outstanding, and Dr. Hochstein is truly an exceptional surgeon. I honestly wish I could give 100 stars instead of just 5. The best of the best!
