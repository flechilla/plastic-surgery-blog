      I had a great experience with Dr. Palmer.  He didn’t try to oversell me or do “too much” like many of the surgeons I met with in Boca Raton.  He did just enough to make me look like a better and more youthful version of myself.  The whole staff is very personable, helpful, friendly and professional.  I’ll definitely use Dr. Palmer in the future if and when I decide to have another procedure.

      I cannot say enough about Dr. Palmer and his team.

      My very first procedure with Dr. Palmer was 25 years ago and it was a success. Fast forward, I have had several other procedures since then and my last procedure was 2 weeks ago. I chose Dr. Palmer then, now and always. He is an amazing surgeon, his office staff is professional and very pleasant. I am very happy with my results and would never consider going any where else!!
