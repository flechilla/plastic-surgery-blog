      My experience for my deep plane neck lift with Dr Chopra was second to none. Not only is he a highly accredited plastic surgeon, but he is extremely personable and his process makes the whole experience feel comfortable. From intake to post-op and beyond, I always felt I was in the best care. I loved the feature of having a caretaker stay with me for the first night, ensuring Dr Chopra was only a

      I underwent a neck lift, face lift, and lip lift with Dr. Chopra—and my results are amazing. I’m 46 and honestly look better than my 20s. As a physician, I did extensive research before choosing him, and he exceeded every expectation: meticulous pre-op planning, flawless execution, and excellent post-op follow-up. He’s also fresh, young, full of life and ambition, with that top-tier Johns Hopkins–
