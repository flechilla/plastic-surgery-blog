      I had a torn earlobe from earring use and got it repaired here. I had a really good experience so far. The staff was super nice and made everything easy and comfortable. Natasha’s very helpful and her response time is very quick. Dr. Stevens did a great job and was friendly. I will come back and post photos after my ear heals. Definitely recommend this office!

      Dr Steven's and Natasha have everything that I would want in a plastic surgeon. I had gotten to the point of not wanting to look in the mirror. I am thrilled with my results of my face-lift,  eye-lift and co2 laser!

He asked me to give him another $500 and he would do another surgery, same purpose and supposedly now, sutures would not be absorbed as the first time, because this time he would use stronger sutures the type your

      I recently had a "dermaplane facial" with Natasha at Dr. Stevens office. It felt amazing and my face feels so soft & smooth. Makeup looks flawless after the dermaplane too. She explained everything & offered some suggestions going forward, which was very helpful! Dr. Stevens also does all my fillers, etc and he is the best! Friendly & takes time to really make you look the best you can and you nev
