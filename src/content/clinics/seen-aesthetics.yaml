      I had a fantastic experience getting the “signature lips” done by Nurse Mariam. As a first-time lip filler patient, I was quite apprehensive, but she put me at ease by thoroughly explaining the procedure and the associated risks. Her step-by-step guidance and at-home care tips made the process seamless. Nurse Mariam's gentle touch and comforting demeanor ensured that I felt comfortable throughout.

      Mariam is the absolute best!! Not only is she extremely professional, but Mariam is honest, and does a phenomenal job in explaining each and every procedure you are interested in or about to be receiving. She will listen to any concerns or hesitations you may have prior to a procedure, and she makes you feel comfortable while taking her time with you. She is soooo talented, as she is able to help

      Mariam is the best injector in South Florida! She always makes me feel so comfortable and is extremely professional and knowledgeable in her field. I plan to expand my procedures with Seen Aesthetics for years to come and trust Miriam and her work wholeheartedly. She is offering a wide range or services and procedures unique to this medical spa and I am excited to see additional offerings from her
