      Had the best experience ever . The staff made me feel comfortable and I came alone ! , Dr. Ortega took his time to explain what he was going to do and he made sure my surgery was smooth . I had a breast reduction with lift and Lipo 360 and he did an amazing job and the pain was 5/10 very manageable
