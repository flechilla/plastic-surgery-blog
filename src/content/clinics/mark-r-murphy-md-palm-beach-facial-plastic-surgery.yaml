      I have had 6 facial surgery consults and by far I was most impressed with Dr. Murphy and his entire staff. From the moment I walked into his office I felt I was welcome and Dr. Murphy saw me immediately for my consultation. Dr. Murphy presented what his course of action would be for my face, which did not include some of the other procedures other surgeons had recommended, of which I was grateful.

Savanah, who works the front desk, is definitely an asset to Dr Murphy, who was always available to answer my questions and concerns. Fro
