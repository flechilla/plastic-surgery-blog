      I had a facial treatment at Fleur Rouge that was absolutely wonderful! The esthetician was knowledgeable about various treatments and skin issues and provided me with guidance on daily maintenance post-facial.  She was also skilled in her application of the facial and I left with a relaxed, glowing face! Looking forward the next one :)

      I had a wonderful experience at Fleur Rouge. The Spa is beautiful. The staff is excellent, very welcoming, and accommodating. They answered all my questions. Dr. V. Harris has a great bedside manner. She did a wonderful job! She is very knowledgeable, and her technique is superb. I would highly recommend Dr. Harris and her staff to my friends and family.

      I don't normally write a review on the places I visit, but this SPA deserved it. All I can say is WORLD CLASS. From the moment you walk through the door, you know this place is special with its calming and peaceful vibe. I had a lovely 80 minute facial. The product line they use is amazing, left my skin, feeling so soft and glowing.. The staff was extremely warm, professional and truly made my day
