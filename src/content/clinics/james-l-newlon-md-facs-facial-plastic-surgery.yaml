      I had a neck lift some years back and now at 74 it may be time for another "tuck". It took some 15 yes 15 years off my appearance and was a very positive experience. The Doctor and staff were honest, down to earth and made it all about ME! Talking to other patients in the waiting room--everyone was positive, relaxed and the outcome was much better than I expected.

The cost is very affordable, and he has a very friendly

      Dr Newlon is a double board certified doctor. He served our Country in the US Army where he learned to reconstruct the faces of war torn soldiers. He knows the anatomy and has the experience. I highly recommend him.
