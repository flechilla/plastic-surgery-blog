      The ladies at Pearl Med Spa area absolutely fantastic, as were the results from my (botox) injections. Not only was the service handled with expert care (thanks, Ericka!) but the staff went out of their way to make sure I was welcome, comfortable and taken care of throughout my treatment- even going as far as to offer a touch-up service and 24-hour check in. I truly can't sing the praises of these
