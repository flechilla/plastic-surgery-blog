      I must have gone to a totally different Premier Spa than the people who wrote the reviews as I found them to be very friendly and courteous .. I used a Groupon for a manicure and thought it was great.. then bought another for a Massage ( and I am very particular about my massages) and had a great gal who knew a lot about the body and gave me some interesting advice The owner is  very gracious....

      Great experience from start to finish. Lovely and clean facilities, very kind and accommodating staff. I had an amazing massage! I didn't want it to end, thank you Reta!! I highly recommend coming here, it's a wonderful spa with great management. After reading the negative reviews I'm quite confused, as this spa was great on all accounts. I will definitely be back :)

      I have been to many places for lash extensions and massages and Premier Day Spa is by far the best. It is a bit small but the service is amazing! Very tranquil atmosphere. Lucy is the best lash technician around!

      Amazing spa!! Great staff, attentive and kind! Perfect location on the beach. Super clean and brand new. The massage and nail service was excellent. Wonderful pool and jacuzzi view of the ocean. I'll be back again!

      Love this spa! I've had my eyelashes done a couple times, and have been very pleased. Great professional staff and ambience. Definitely recommend them for that and much more!!
