      About 3 years ago I had the bump shaved down on my nose and a mini neck lift done at this Clinic.  All the staff were beyond wonderful and Dr. DeRosa is lovely. My only complaint is I wish I had listened to her advice and gone for the more extensive treatments.  I did not get the results that I was looking for, no fault of the doctor. Dr DeRosa did some touch up for no charge, because she honestly

      Stay away from this place. Read the reviews! Save your money and face from this fraud! dr.derosa has no skills as a plastic surgeon. She took money, left me with empty promises, and a worse nose than I had before surgery.  Dr. derosa is a disgrace to the medical community!  She should have stopped practicing on patients' faces! I paid her for the nose job 12K, but now to fix it, I have to pay 25K.

      The DeRosa clinic is one of my favorite spots in Boston. I schedule visits around  Dr. DeRosa and lead aesthetician, Steven Giannetta’s availability.  The practice is located centrally on Newbury Street in the heart of Back Bay. The experience is pleasant and effortless from ease of communication with appointment schedulers to greeting when you walk through the doors.  The office is gorgeous with

      I've always had excellent results from all treatments and procedures at DeRosa Clinic. I recently, had Candela Profound Laser with PRP Therapy and Aquagold. The results are unbelievable!!!!! Dr. DeRosa explained every step including the sound of the laser. I felt comfortable and that I was in good hands. I'm thrilled with my new younger look! Thank you Dr. DeRosa!
