      Just one day post PRF EZ Gel injections and already so happy with my results. Michelle was professional, patient, and incredibly knowledgeable. I felt well-informed and comfortable from start to finish. Highly recommend if you’re considering PRF or Botox.

      I tried Michelle after years with another injector and I’m so glad I did. She did my lips and Botox and I’m extremely happy with the results. She even made time for me before my vacation despite her busy schedule. Highly impressed and highly recommend!
