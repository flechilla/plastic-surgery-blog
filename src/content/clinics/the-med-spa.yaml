She has helped me preserve and highlight aspects of my face  in such a natural way yet never ove

      My experience here was amazing, I'm so happy! I spent a loooong time debating injections and Dr. Kamii was recommended by so many people. Everyone I met here was very nice and friendly. It was my first time having injections and I felt totally calm and comfortable. I'm so happy I chose the Medspa, I'll never go anywhere else!

      Kami is the sweetest person ever. I did my lip fillers with her for my birthday; I was extremely nervous since I had a virgin face and she made sure I was comfortable and clarified all of my doubts. I wouldn’t trust no one else but her. Hands down!
