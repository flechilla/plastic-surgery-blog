      We started full-body laser hair removal with Jane and it’s been such a great experience. She’s knowledgeable, patient, and makes the process feel easy (and way less intimidating).

      I had a wonderful experience at Astra Med Spa! I came in for a facial cleansing treatment, and I was impressed from the very beginning. The staff was warm and welcoming, and the environment was clean, calm, and relaxing. The facial itself was incredibly thorough and left my skin feeling fresh, smooth, and deeply cleansed. But what truly stood out was the personalized approach — after the treatment

      I had a wonderful experience at Astra Beauty Lounge. I had an extraction facial. After this treatment my skin felt so smooth and no more clogged pores, my skin tone and texture evened out!   Jane is an amazing and knowledgeable esthetician! She recommends treatments according to your skin type. And the salon itself is very clean and beautiful. I will definitely be back!
