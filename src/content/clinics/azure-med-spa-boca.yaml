      I went to azure med spa For the first time today and I was extremely pleased! I bought a Groupon for 40 units of Botox and ended up also purchasing some Juvéderm filler for my smile lines.

I was a bit nervous. The

      I did the VI Peel with Nelly, and she’s not only a skilled esthetician, but also incredibly kind and caring. She takes the time to explain every detail of her treatments, making you feel comfortable and informed. I wish I have met her long ago. Thank you Nelly for taking care of my skin.

      Nelly was exceptional. She took her time and educated me through the process of getting the VI Peel along with maintaining it. She was gentle with my skin and based on the conversation you could tell she was both passionate & professional. The space was also very nice, clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend!
