      I had such a great experience at Ora Wellness Center! From the moment I walked in, the atmosphere was calm, clean, and welcoming. Lidia is incredibly professional and precise — she made me feel completely comfortable during both my Botox and VI Peel treatments, and the results are amazing! My skin looks refreshed and natural.  A special thank you to Nicole, who’s always in touch, answers all quest

      My first experience having lip filler couldn't have been better anywhere else. Everything from the thorough, professional consultation to the actual procedure was all I hope for! Definitely boosted self-confidence and esteem!  Thanks Lidia!

      I began my IV Therapy at Ora Wellness a. year ago & much to my surprise I knew this would be the one & only location I would be loyal to. From the minute you walk in you are greeted by the entire staff & Lidia who is most professional & has tremendous knowledge in the wellness world. I highly recommend Ora Wellness. I have referred two friends who were so very pleased with her services. Thank you
