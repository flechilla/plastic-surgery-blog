      Dr. White is incredible. Not only does he have great bedside manner, but you can tell he truly cares about his patients and the results of surgery. He took the time to answer all of my questions/concerns ahead of time and made me feel comfortable going into the procedure. The actual procedure went great, and so far, I've been healing wonderfully. Can't recommend Dr. White enough!
